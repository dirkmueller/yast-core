    <h1>Real modules in YCP</h1>
    <h2>Towards classes and objects</h2>
Didn't you miss 'real' classes and object like functions in YCP ?<BR>
With a clear environment and parse-time binding ?<BR>
No you can have it !<BR>
<BR>
<h3>The old behaviour</h3>
YCP, originally planned as a functional language, always did dynamic
(i.e. runtime) binding of variables. Although useful in some cases,
it's quite puzzling for everyone used to 'imperative' languages.<BR>
So you could well program the following block
<PRE>
{
   integer x = 42;

   define f() ``{ return x; }

   ... // lots of lines

   x = 55;

   return f();	// will return 55 !
}
</PRE>
and get an unexpected result.<BR>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
Another mis-used feature is <tt>include</tt> for special, global definitions.
Without 'real' modules, there is no alternative to include, so it was widely
accepted but<BR>
<UL>include just does that, it executes a complete file every time the include
is evaluated
</UL>
which is bad memory-wise and speed-wise.<BR>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h3>The new behaviour</h3>
Modules help a lot since they do<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Have definition-time bindings.</LI>
<LI>One-time inclusion.</LI>
<LI>Have their own namespace.</LI>
<LI>Have a local environment.</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
Modules are a lot like include files, but they start with a <tt>module</tt>
statement specifying their name.<BR>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
Example:<BR>
<PRE>
{
   // This is a module called "Sample"
   // It is stored in /usr/lib/YaST2/modules/Sample.ycp

   module "Sample";

   // this is a local declaration.
   // it can only be 'seen' inside the module.

   integer local_var = 42;

   // this is a global declaration.
   // it can be accessed from outside.

   global integer global_var = 27;

   // this is a global function
   // it has access to global_var *and* local_var

   global define sample_f () ``{ return local_var + global_var; }

}
</PRE><BR>
The above module can now be used with the <tt>import</tt> statement.<BR>
<tt>import</tt> has a similar syntax for file names like <tt>include</tt>.
The interpreter automatically appends <tt>".ycp"</tt> to the filename
and searches below <tt>/usr/lib/YaST2/modules</tt>. If the filename
starts with <tt>"./"</tt>, the file is loaded from the local directory.
<BR>
<BR>
<b>Caution:</b> The file must have the same name as the module !<BR>
<BR>
Inside modules, only variable or function declaration statements are
allowed. You can't have blocks or any kind of evaluation statements.<BR>
<BR>
The global declarations of the module are accessed with <tt>Sample::</TT>.<BR>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
Example:<BR>
<PRE>
{
    import "Sample";

    integer i = Sample::sample_f();	// == 69

    i = Sample::local_var;		// ERROR, no access possible !

    i = Sample::global_var;		// == 27

    Sample::global_var = 0;		// this variable is writable !!

    return Sample::sample_f();		// == 42, since global_var is 0
}
</PRE><BR>
The statement <tt>import "Sample";</tt> triggers the loading of
<tt>Sample.ycp</tt> when first encountered. Subsequent import
statements are ignored, since "Sample" is already defined.<BR>
So you can't replace a module during runtime !<BR>
<BR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h3>Modules with constructors.</h3>
If a global function with the same name as the module is defined, it
is treated as a constructor. The constructor is called after the
module is loaded and evaluated. So the constructor might be at the
beginning of the module and use functions declared later in the file.<BR>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
Example:<BR>
<PRE>
{
   // This is a module called "Class" with a constructor
   // It is stored in /usr/lib/YaST2/modules/Sample.ycp

   module "Class";

   global integer class_var = 42;

   // this is the constructor

   global define Class() ``{ class_var = 12345; }
}

{
    import "Class";

    return Class::class_var;		// will be 12345 !
}
</PRE><BR>
Constructors can't have any arguments. The result of calling the
constructor is ignored.
