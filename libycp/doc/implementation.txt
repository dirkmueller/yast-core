Variables and Scope


  Variables are always associated with a namespace.
  Either a known namespace (with a name)
  or the global namespace (no name, but distinguished)
  or a local namespace (no name)

  All namespaces are defined within a block, so all variables
  belong to a block.
  There's one exception: formal arguments to a function. Such
  variables neither belong to the block surrounding the function,
  nor to the block defining the function body.


  Treat variables as 'slots' inside a block. Reference them
  as block + slot_offset at runtime. Symbol tables are only
  needed during parse time to look up symbols by name. Names
  are not part of runtime, just handy for log or error output.

  -> distinguish parse-time from run-time !
