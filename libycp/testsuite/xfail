  This file lists cases known to fail that will be fixed later.
  So this is the list of missing features.

  Lines beginning with white space are ignored.


  Each 'bug' starts with a header consisting of
  - a number
  - a short description, explaining the bug 'area'
  - an optional "Assigned to" line, if someone is currently working
    in this area
  - a long description, characterizing the bug, explaining other failure
    scenarious, explaining the testcase and the expected output.
    optionally with fix suggestions or some (good ;-)) reasons for not fixing the bug.

  There is an empty line before each header


  1. Bracket operators are not implemented yet, except syntactically
  Bracket operators should allow accessing (and writing) lists and maps
  Bracket: Fixed 2002-11-19
  BracketAssign is implemented now but preventing the alias trap using
  eval still fails.
  BracketAssign re-implemented as YSBracket instead of builtin. Assignment
  always creates a duplicate, see statements/BracketAlias, 2003-01-26
  BracketAssign

  2. GlobalSymbols
  Currently not fully specified
  GS2 overrides a local function with a global one - SEGV.
  GS3 overrides a local func with a local one - SEGV.
  I think we could simply declare it an error, for a start.
  Just don't segv.
  Fixed: 2002-11-20
  GlobalSymbols
  GlobalSymbols2
  GlobalSymbols3

  3. Haskey
  Currently not fully specified
  haskey(nilmap, whatever) should simply return false, not segv.
  passing nil is wrong in the first place, nil is no value but
  an exception. Segfault fixed.
  Fixed: 2002-11-21
  Haskey

  4. ImpInc
  Currently not fully specified
 ImpInc

  5. ImpSelf
  Currently not fully specified
 ImpSelf

  6. Lookup
  Currently not fully specified
  lookup (nilmap, whatever, default) should return default.
  Almost duplicate #3, but lookup has it's own YELookup() class (why ?)
  Fixed: 2002-11-21
  Lookup2

  7. Circular1
  Currently not fully specified
 circular_M1

  8. Circular2
  Currently not fully specified
 circular_M2

  9. Circular3
  Currently not fully specified
 circular_m1

  10. Circular4
  Currently not fully specified
 circular_m2


  11. Empty module
  ** Currently not fully specified
  Fixed 2002-11-18
  emptyModule


  12. Empty function body
  Report whatever error, just don't segv. See the test body.
  Fixed 2002-11-18
  empty_body4


  13. Empty Module 2 - duplicate with 12 !
  Fixed 2002-11-18
  emptymodule


  14. Flatten nested lists
  Currently not fully specified
  The overload resolution code seems to have a minor bug in error reporting
  Fixed 2002-11-22
  flatten
 #funcptr
 #funcptr2

  15. impinc1
  Currently not fully specified
 impinc1

  16. impinc2
  Currently not fully specified
 impinc2

  17. impself
  Currently not fully specified
 impself

  18. Include and scope
  Fixed 2002-11-14

  19. 'is' optimization fails
  Assigned to: mvidner
  Needs turning off IS_IS_OPTIMIZED but that breaks other things
 list

  20. matchtype
  ycp2 apparently had a total ordering over all ycpvalues.
  But see bug 21769
  ycp3 fails to compare integer and float.
 matchtype

  21. Module function call
  Calling a simple function in a simple module does not work
  even if the "module statement in sub-block" check is disabled.
  Fixed: 2002-12-19
  Actually YEFunction::toString does not print the module name but it
  is minor.
  module0i

  22. Module variable reference
  Referencing a variable in a simple module does not work
  even if the "module statement in sub-block" check is disabled.
  Fixed: 2002-12-19
  module1i

  23. Module constructor
  Using a constructor in a simple module does not work
  even if the "module statement in sub-block" check is disabled.
 moduleci

  24. D_RepeatUntil
  segfault, probably duplicate with #2
  Fixed: 2002-11-20
  D_RepeatUntil

  25. Define
  segfault, probably duplicate with #2
  Fixed: 2002-11-20
  Define

  26. Single file module-and-import
  This test case takes advantage of defining a module and importing it
  in the same file. This only worked in runycp and was broken when #21
  and 22 were fixed. foo2 and foo2i are equivalent replacements.
  I consider it minor.
