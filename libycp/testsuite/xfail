  This file lists cases known to fail that will be fixed later.
  So this is the list of missing features.

  Lines beginning with white space are ignored.


  Each 'bug' starts with a header consisting of
  - a number
  - a short description, explaining the bug 'area'
  - an optional "Assigned to" line, if someone is currently working
    in this area
  - a long description, characterizing the bug, explaining other failure
    scenarious, explaining the testcase and the expected output.
    optionally with fix suggestions or some (good ;-)) reasons for not fixing the bug.

  There is an empty line before each header


  14. Flatten nested lists
  Currently not fully specified
  The overload resolution code seems to have a minor bug in error reporting
  Fixed 2002-11-22

  19. 'is' optimization fails
  Assigned to: mvidner
  Needs turning off IS_IS_OPTIMIZED but that breaks other things

  23. Module constructor
  Using a constructor in a simple module does not work
  even if the "module statement in sub-block" check is disabled.
 moduleci

  26. Single file module-and-import
  This test case takes advantage of defining a module and importing it
  in the same file. This only worked in runycp and was broken when #21
  and 22 were fixed. foo2 and foo2i are equivalent replacements.
  I consider it minor.
