<H1>Using the package manager</H1>
<H2>Intro</H2>
This is a short introduction into using the package manager
interface from within YCP code.<br>
It describes the required <tt>Pkg::</tt> calls and
how to use them in actual code.<br>
<br>
<H2>Implementation</H2>
The new package manager does all package related handling
inside C++ code and uses callbacks for user interaction.<br>
This reduces the amount of ycp code needed for package installation
(or removal) to a few lines.<br>
The package manager keeps a list of installed (on the system)
and available (on the CD or other installation media) packages
and their status (install, delete, no change). YCP code
can query the package manager for installed or available
packages and set their status. The actual package installation
or deletion takes place with a final commit call.<br>
This call goes through the package list and deletes all
packages marked as such. Then it orderes the packages marked
for installation according to their "PreRequires" rpm tag
and the media number (so you usually install CDs in ascending
order).<br>
All user interaction is done via callbacks from inside the
package manager. If no callback is defined, the user doesn't
see anything and also isn't requested to change CDs. Especially
the latter case makes it important to set up appropriate callbacks.<br>
<br>
<H2>Querying the package manager</H2>
<h3>Checking an installed package</h3>
<tt>boolean Pkg::IsProvided (string)</tt> checks if a rpm tag (a package name
or any other symbolic name provided by a package) is installed.<br>
It does a '<tt>rpm -q</tt>' and if this fails a '<tt>rpm -q --whatprovides</tt>'
for the given tag.<br>
It does <b>not</b> start the complete package manager.<br>
<br>
<h3>Checking the installation sources</h3>
<tt>boolean Pkg::IsAvailable(string)</tt> checks if a rpm package is available for installation.<br>
(It currently does not check for other tags provided, this will be implemented
in a future version.)<br>
It starts the package manager if it isn't running already. Starting the package manager
may take some time since it must read all it's caches about the installation
sources and set up the internal data structures.<br>
<br>
<h3>Deleting a package</h3>
<tt>boolean Pkg::PkgDelete (string)</tt> marks an installed package for
deletion. It does <b>not</b> immediately run '<tt>rpm -e</tt>' but
just sets the internal status of the package in the package manager.<br>
The actual deletion must be triggered with <tt>Pkg::PkgCommit()</tt><br>.
<br>
<h3>Installing a package</h3>
<tt>boolean Pkg::PkgInstall (string)</tt> marks an available package for
installation. It does <b>not</b> immediately run '<tt>rpm -Uhv</tt>' but
just sets the internal status of the package in the package manager.<br>
The actual installation must be triggered with <tt>Pkg::PkgCommit()</tt><br>.
<br>
<h3>Solving dependencies</h3>
<tt>boolean Pkg::PkgSolve()<tt> tries to solve open package dependencies
and marks other (dependant) packages for installation/deletion.<br>
(It currently does an automatic solving without user interaction. Callbacks
for user interaction will be added later.)<br>
<br>
<H3>Committing the changes</h3>
<tt>list Pkg::PkgCommit (integer)</tt> does the '<tt>rpm</tt>' calls
needed to install or delete packages.<br>
It sorts the packages according to their pre-requires and their
location on the media (CD order), handles mouting/unmounting of
the media, does the package download (if the media is an ftp or
http server), and calls rpm.<br>
All these actions might trigger callbacks for user information
or user actions (i.e. media change).<br>
The module <tt>PackageCallbacks</tt> from <tt>yast2-packager.rpm</tt>
defined default callbacks for all these actions and should be
imported by any code using <tt>Pkg::PkgCommit(0)</tt>.<br>
The integer parameter given to <tt>Pkg::PkgCommit(0)</tt> must
be zero for the normal usage. Non-zero values are only allowed
during system installation when no media change is possible.<br>
<br>
<h2>Example code</h2>
<pre>
{
    import "PackageCallbacks";

    // installing netscape and cups

    Pkg::PkgInstall ("netscape");
    Pkg::PkgInstall ("cups");

    // deleting lprng if it is installed

    if (Pkg::IsProvided ("lprng"))
	Pkg::PkgDelete ("lprng");

    // fill open dependencies
    Pkg::PkgSolve();

    // do the rpm calls
    Pkg::PkgCommit();

}
