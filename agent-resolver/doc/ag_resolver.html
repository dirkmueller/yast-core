Some notes about the resolver agent

General
-------

The target agent is the SCR interface to /etc/resolv.conf,
the resolver (name server) configuration file.

Since it has multi-line configuration options (e.g. 'nameserver'),
it can't be handled by the current AnyAgent.


Paths
-----
The Target agent is mounted to the '.resolver' path of the SCR
namespace. See the RESOLVER(5) manual page for details about the
semantics of the resolver configuration file.

Comment tags have been added to the /etc/resolv.conf file (see
http://w3.suse.de/~poeml/resolv.conf-modification-howto.txt) and thus
resolver agent understand these tags and provide interface to them.
All of the infos are strings (and may contains '\n' character to be for
than one line, but then all new lines MUST start with '#').

Path for enforcing/disabling of writing info headers is now also
present. The path is '.resolver.write_header' and is only for
writing. The boolean value is used to force/disable writing of info headers.

Implemented paths are

Read(.resolver.search) -> list of domain names
Read(.resolver.nameserver) -> list of nameserver IP addresses
Read(.resolver.domain) -> local domain name
Read(.resolver.sortlist) -> list of sort options
Read(.resolver.options) -> list of resolver options

Info paths

Read(.resolver.modified) -> string
Read(.resolver.backup)   -> string
Read(.resolver.process)   -> string
Read(.resolver.process_id)   -> string
Read(.resolver.script)   -> string
Read(.resolver.info)   -> string


The write calls

Write(.resolver.search, ["domain1", "domain2"])
Write(.resolver.nameserver, ["IP1", "IP2", "IP3"])
Write(.resolver.domain, "domain.name")
Write(.resolver.sortlist, ["sort1", "sort2", "sort3"])
Write(.resolver.options, ["opt1", "opt2", "opt3"])


To write info paths

Write(.resolver.modified, <i>string</i>)
Write(.resolver.backup, <i>string</i>)
Write(.resolver.process, <i>string</i>)
Write(.resolver.process_id, <i>string</i>)
Write(.resolver.script, <i>string</i>)
Write(.resolver.info, <i>string</i>)

Write(.resolver.write_header, <i>boolean</i>)

just change the in-memory copy of /etc/resolv.conf

Use

Write (.resolv, <i>any value</i>)

to 'flush' the data to /etc/resolv.conf. This is also done
when un-mounting the agent.
