#               If you don't like your resolv.conf to be changed, you
#               can set MODIFY_{RESOLV,NAMED}_CONF_DYNAMICALLY=no. This
#               variables are placed in /etc/sysconfig/network/config.

#               You can also configure service dhcpcd not to modify it.
#               
#               If you don't like dhcpcd to change your nameserver
#               settings
#               then either set DHCLIENT_MODIFY_RESOLV_CONF=no
#               in /etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp, or
#               set MODIFY_RESOLV_CONF_DYNAMICALLY=no in
#               /etc/sysconfig/network/config or (manually) use dhcpcd
#               with -R.  If you only want to keep your searchlist, set
#               DHCLIENT_KEEP_SEARCHLIST=yes in /etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp or
#               (manually) use the -K option.
