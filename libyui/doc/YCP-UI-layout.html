<h2>Summary: What's This All About?</h2>

<p>
This is both a tutorial and a reference on how to lay out YaST2 dialogs.

<p>
Since experience shows that most people begin this with only a vague perception
of YaST2's concepts, it also includes some basics that might be covered in
other YaST2 documentation as well - just enough to get started.

<h2>Basics and Terms
	<a name="basics"></a>
</h2>

<p>
If you are in a hurry or - like most developers - you don't like to read docs,
you can skip this section and move right on to the
<a href="#impatient_reader">next section</a>.

That is, if you think you know what the next few headlines mean. You can always
come back here later.


<p>
Just don't ask anything that is explained here on the <i>yast2-hackers</i>
mailing list - you'll very likely just get a plain <i>RTFM</i> answer shot
right back into your face. And <b>this is the FM</b>, so read it
if you need explanations. ;-)



<h3>The UI
	<a name="ui"></a>
</h3>

<p>
The UI (user interface) is that part of YaST2 that displays dialogs. It is a
separate process which uses a separate interpreter. Always think of it as
something running on a different machine: There is the machine you want to
install with YaST2 (i.e. the machine where the disks will be formatted etc.)
and there is the machine that displays the dialogs - the UI machine. In most
cases, this will actually be the same machine. But it doesn't need to be. Both
parts of YaST2 might as well run on different machines connected via a serial
line, a network or by some other means of communication (telepathy? ;-)  ).


<p>
The logical consequence of this is that the UI uses its own separate set of
function definitions and variables. You need to be real careful not to mix that
up. Always keep in mind what part of YaST2 needs to do what and what variables
need to be stored where. You can easily tell by the <tt>UI</tt> prefix within
the YCP code what parts are getting executed by the UI.


<h3>Widgets
	<a name="widgets"></a>
</h3>

<p>
A <i>widget</i> is the most basic building block of the
<a href="#ui">UI</a>.
In short, each single dialog item like a PushButton, a SelectionBox or a
TextEntry field is a widget. But there are more: Most static texts in dialogs
are widgets, too. And there are a lot of widgets you can't see: Layout boxes
like <i>HBox</i> or <i>VBox</i> and many more that don't actually display
something but arrange other widgets in some way.


<p>
See the <a href="widgets/index.html">widget reference</a> for details
and a list of all available widgets.



<h3>UI Independence and the <i>libyui</i>
	<a name="ui_indepencence"></a>
</h3>


<p>
There are several different <a href="#ui">UIs</a> for YaST2. There is the
<a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/index.html">Qt</a>
based UI (<i>y2qt</i>) as a graphical frontend which requires the X Window
System; this is what most people know as the "normal" YaST2 UI.  But there is
also a NCurses based UI (<i>y2ncurses</i>) for text terminals or consoles. A
web UI (<i>y2web</i>) is being developed at the time of this writing.


<p>
That means, of course, that all YaST2 dialogs need to be written in a way that
is compatible with each of those UIs. This is why <i>libyui</i> was introduced
as an intermediate abstract layer between the YCP application and the UI. You
do not communicate directly with either <i>y2qt</i>, <i>y2ncurses</i> or
<i>y2web</i> - you communicate with the libyui.


<p>
Thus, YaST2 dialogs need to be described logically rather than in terms of
pixel sizes and positions: You specify some buttons to be arranged next to each
other rather than at positions (200, 50), (200, 150), (200, 200) etc. -
whatever exactly this "next to each other" means to the specific UI.


<p>
Add to that the fact that there are several dialog languages to choose from:
User messages or button labels have different lengths in different languages.
Just compare the length of English messages to those in German or French, and
you'll discover another good reason not to hard-code coordinates.


<p>
In addition to that, always keep in mind that
<b>the same dialog might require a different amount of space in a different UI</b>.
Overcrowded dialogs don't look good in the Qt UI. In the NCurses UI, they will
very likely break completely: There simply isn't as much space available (80x25
characters vs. 640x480 pixels).



<h3>The Nice Size
	<a name="nice_size"></a>
</h3>

<p>
Each widget has a so-called <i>nice size</i> - this is the size the widget
would like to have in order to look nice. E.g. for PushButtons that means the
entire button label fits into the button. Likewise for labels.


<p>
Then there are widgets that don't have a natural nice size. For example, what
size should a SelectionBox get? It can scroll anyway, so anything that makes at
least one line of the list visible will satisfy the basic requirements. More
space will make it look nicer; but how much is enough? The widget cannot tell
that by itself.


<p>
Such widgets report a somewhat random size as their <i>nice size</i>. This is a
number chosen for debugging purposes rather than for aesthetics. You almost
always need to specify the size from the outside for that very reason. Always
supply a <a href="#weights">weight</a> for such widgets or
<a href="#scrollable_sizes">surround them with spacings</a>.



<h3>Initial Dialog Sizes
	<a name="initial_dialog_sizes"></a>
</h3>


<p>
By default, all dialogs will be as large as they need to be - up to full screen
size (which is UI dependent - 640x480 pixels for Qt, 80x25 characters for
NCurses): The outermost widget is asked what size it would like to have,
i.e. its <a href="#nice_size">nice size</a>. If that outermost widget has any
children, for example because it is a <a href="#layout_boxes">layout box</a>,
it will ask all of its children and sum up the individual sizes. Those in turn
may have to ask their children and so on.  The resulting size will be the
dialog's initial size - unless, of course, this would exceed the screen size
(UI dependent, see above).


<h3>Full Screen Dialogs: `opt(`defaultsize)
	<a name="defaultsize"></a>
</h3>

<p>
You can force full screen size for any dialog by setting the
<tt>`defaultsize</tt> option when opening it:

<blockquote>
<pre>
OpenDialog(
           `opt(`defaultsize ),
	   `VBox(...)
          );

</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
This will create a dialog of 640x480 pixels (<i>y2qt</i>) or 80x25 characters
(<i>y2ncurses</i>) - regardless of its contents.


<p>
Use this for main windows or for popup dialogs with very much the same
semantics - e.g. many of the YaST2 installation wizard's "expert" dialogs. Even
though they are technically popup dialogs and they return to the main thread of
dialog sequence they have main window semantics to the user.


<p>
Use your common sense when considering whether or not to use this feature for a
particular dialog.


<p>
<b>Note:</b> Not every UI may be capable of this feature. This is only a hint to
the UI; you cannot blindly rely on it being honored.

<h2>Layout Building Blocks
	<a name="building_blocks"></a>
</h2>


<p>
This section covers the widgets used for creating dialog layouts - the kind of
widgets that are less obvious to the user. If you are interested in the "real"
widgets, i.e. the kind you can actually see, please refer to the
<a href="widgets/index.html">widget reference</a>.




<h3>Layout Boxes:
	<a name="layout_boxes"></a>
	<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">HBox</a>
	and
	<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">VBox</a>
</h3>


<p>
This is the most basic and also the most natural layout widget.

The <a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">HBox</a> widget arranges two or more
widgets horizontally, i.e. left to right.
The <a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">VBox</a> arranges two or more widgets
vertically, i.e. top to bottom.

<p>
The strategy used for doing this is the same, just the dimensions (horizontal /
vertical) are different. Each child widget will be positioned logically next to
its neighbor. You don't have to care about exact sizes and positions; the
layout box will do that for you.

<p>
See the description of the
<a href="#layout_algorithm">layout algorithm</a> for details.


<p>
For creating more complex layouts, nest HBox and VBox widgets into each
other. Usually you will have a structure very much like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>

`VBox(
      `HBox(...),
      `HBox(...),
      ...
      )

</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
i.e. a VBox that has several HBoxes inside. Those in turn can have VBoxes
inside etc. - nest as deep as you like.


<p>
Almost every kind of layout can be broken down into such columns (i.e. VBoxes)
or rows (i.e. HBoxes). If you feel you can't do that with your special layout,
try using <a href="#weights">weights</a>.



<h3>Specifying Proportions:
	<a name="weights"></a>
	<a href="widgets/YWeight-widget.html">HWeight</a>
	and
	<a href="widgets/YWeight-widget.html">VWeight</a>
</h3>


<p>
By default, each widget in a layout box (i.e. in a HBox or a VBox) will get its
<a href="#nice_size">nice size</a>, no more and no less. If for any reason you
don't want that, you can exactly specify the proportions of each widget in the
layout box. You do that by supplying the widgets with a <i>weight</i> (to be
more exact: by making it the child of a weight widget, a <a
href="widgets/YWeight-widget.html">HWeight</a> or a <a
href="widgets/YWeight-widget.html">VWeight</a>).


<p>
You can specify percentages for weights, or you can choose random numbers. The
layout engine will add the weights of all children of a layout box and
calculate percentages for each widget automatically. Specify a <b>HWeight</b>
for <b>HBox</b> children and a <b>VWeight</b> for <b>VBox</b> children.


<h4>Example 1:</h4>

<blockquote>
<pre>
`HBox(
      `HWeight( 20, `PushButton( "OK"     ) ),
      `HWeight( 50, `PushButton( "Cancel" ) ),
      `HWeight( 30, `PushButton( "Help"   ) )
     )
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
In this example, the "OK" button will get 20%, the "Cancel" button 50% and the
"Help" button 30% of the available space. In this example, the weights add up
to 100, but they don't need to.


<p>
<i><b>Note:</b> This dialog looks extremely ugly - don't try this at home, kids</i>
;-)


<p>
<b>The weight ratios will be maintained at all times</b>, even if that means
violating <a href="#nice_size">nice size</a> restrictions (i.e. a widget gets
less space than it needs). You are the boss; if you specify weights, the layout
engine assumes you know what you are doing.


<h4>Example 2:</h4>

<p>
(See also
<a href="#equal">creating widgets of equal size</a> in the
<a href="#common_techniques">common layout techniques</a> section)

<blockquote>
<pre>
`HBox(
      `HWeight( 1, `PushButton( "OK"     ) ),
      `HWeight( 1, `PushButton( "Cancel" ) ),
      `HWeight( 1, `PushButton( "Help"   ) )
     )
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i><b>Note:</b> This is a very common technique</i>.

<p>
In this example all buttons will get an equal size. The button with the largest
label will determine the overall size and thus the size of each individual
button.


<p>
Please note how the weights do not add up to 100 here. The value "1" is
absolutely random; we might as well have specified "42" for each button to
achieve that effect.


<h4>Example 3:</h4>

<p>
The YaST2 wizard layout reserves 30% of horizontal space for the help text
(a <a href="widgets/YRichText-widget.html">RichText</a> widget)
and the remaining 70% for the rest of the dialog.
The important part of that code (simplified for demonstration purposes) looks
like that:

<blockquote>
<pre>
`HBox(
      `HWeight( 30, `RichText( "Help text") ),
      `HWeight( 70, `VBox(
			  ...	// the dialog contents
			  `HBox(
				`PushButton( "Back"),
				`HCenter( `PushButton( "Abort Installation") ),
				`PushButton( "Next")
                               )
			  )
              )
      )
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
Specifying the size of the help text like that is important for most kinds of
widgets that can scroll - like the RichText widget used here, for example. The
RichText widget can take any amount of space available; it will wrap lines by
itself as long as possible and provide scroll bars as necessary. Thus, it
cannot supply any reasonable default size on its own - you must supply one. We
chose 30% of the screen space - which of course is absolutely random but suits
well for the purposes of YaST2.


<p>
Use this technique for widgets like the
<a href="widgets/YSelectionBox-widget.html">SelectionBox</a>, the
<a href="widgets/YTable-widget.html">Table widget</a>, the
<a href="widgets/YTree-widget.html">Tree widget</a>, the
<a href="widgets/YRichText-widget.html">RichText</a>,
but also for less obvious ones like the
<a href="widgets/YTextEntry-widget.html">TextEntry</a>.


<p>
<b>Note:</b> This list may be incomplete. Use your common sense.


<h3>Rubber Bands:
	<a name="rubber_bands"></a>
	<a href="widgets/YEmpty-widget.html">HStretch</a>
	and
	<a href="widgets/YEmpty-widget.html">VStretch</a>
</h3>


<p>
When you don't want parts of a dialog to be resized just because some
neighboring widget needs more space, you can insert <i>stretch</i> widgets to
take any excess space.
Insert a
<a href="widgets/YEmpty-widget.html">HStretch</a> in a
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">HBox</a> or a
<a href="widgets/YEmpty-widget.html">VStretch</a> in a
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">VBox</a>.
Those will act as "rubber bands" and leave the other widgets in the
corresponding layout box untouched.


<p>
You can also insert several stretches in one layout box; excess space will be
evenly distributed among them.


<p>
If there is no excess space, stretch widgets will be invisible. They don't
consume any space unless there is too much of it (or unless you explicitly told
them to - e.g. by using <a href="#weights">weights</a>).



<h3>Making Common Widgets Stretchable: `opt(`hstretch) and `opt(`vstretch)
	<a name="opt_stretch"></a>
</h3>


<p>
Some widgets that are not stretchable by default can be made stretchable by
setting the <tt>`hstretch</tt> option.
<a href="widgets/YPushButton-widget.html">PushButtons</a> are typical
candidates for this: They normally consume only as much space as they really
need, i.e. their <a href="#nice_size">nice size</a>. With the
<tt>`hstretch</tt> option, however, they can grow and take any extra space -
very much like <a href="#rubber_bands">stretch</a> widgets.


<p>
Please note, however, that all widgets for with a <a href="#weights">weight</a>
are implicitly stretchable anyway, so specifying <tt>`opt(`hstretch)</tt> or
<tt>`opt(`vstretch)</tt> for them as well is absolutely redundant.



<h3>Spacings:
	<a name="spacings"></a>
	<a href="widgets/YSpacing-widget.html">HSpacing</a>
	and
	<a href="widgets/YSpacing-widget.html">VSpacing</a>
</h3>


<p>
Use
<a href="widgets/YSpacing-widget.html">HSpacing</a> or
<a href="widgets/YSpacing-widget.html">VSpacing</a>
to create some empty space within a layout.
This is normally used for aesthetical reasons only - to make dialogs
appear less cramped.


<p>
The size of a spacing is specified as a float number, measured in units roughly
equivalent to the size of a character in the respective UI (1/80 of the
<a href="#defaultsize">full screen width</a> horizontally , 1/25 of the full
screen width vertically).  Fractional numbers can be used here, but text based
UIs may choose to round the number as appropriate - even if this means simply
ignoring a spacing when its size becomes zero.


<p>
You can combine the effects of a
<a href="#spacings">spacing</a> and a
<a href="#rubber_bands">stretch</a> if you specify a
<a href="#opt_stretch">hstretch</a> or a
<a href="#opt_stretch">vstretch</a> option for it:
You will have a rubber band that will take at least the specified amount of
space. Use this to create nicely spaced dialogs with a reasonable resize
behaviour.

<h4>Example:</h4>

<blockquote>
<pre>
`HBox(
      `PushButton( "OK"	),
      `HSpacing( `opt(`hstretch), 0.5),
      `PushButton( "Cancel" )
     )
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
This will create two buttons with a spacing between them. When the dialog is
resized, the spacing will grow.


<h3>Alignments:
	<a name="alignments"></a>
	<a href="widgets/YAlignment-widget.html">Left</a>,
	<a href="widgets/YAlignment-widget.html">Right</a>,
	<a href="widgets/YAlignment-widget.html">HCenter</a>,
	<a href="widgets/YAlignment-widget.html">Top</a>,
	<a href="widgets/YAlignment-widget.html">Bottom</a>,
	<a href="widgets/YAlignment-widget.html">VCenter</a>,
	<a href="widgets/YAlignment-widget.html">HVCenter</a>
</h3>


<p>
Alignments are widgets that align their single child widget in some way.


<p>
<a href="widgets/YAlignment-widget.html">HCenter</a> centers horizontally,
<a href="widgets/YAlignment-widget.html">VCenter</a> centers vertically,
<a href="widgets/YAlignment-widget.html">HVCenter</a> centers both
horizontally and vertically. The others align their child as the name implies.



<p>
More often than not, you could achieve the same effect with a clever
combination of
<a href="#spacings">spacings</a>,
but sometimes this might require an additional
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">HBox</a> within a
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">HBox</a> or a
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">VBox</a> within a
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">VBox</a>,
i.e. more overhead.



<h3>Compressing Excess Space:
	<a name="squash"></a>
	<a href="widgets/YSquash-widget.html">HSquash</a>,
	<a href="widgets/YSquash-widget.html">VSquash</a>,
	<a href="widgets/YSquash-widget.html">HVSquash</a>
</h3>


<p>
Sometimes you wish to squeeze any extra space from a part of a dialog. This
might be necessary if you want to draw a <a href="#frame">frame</a> around a
RadioBox in a <a href="#defaultsize">defaultsize</a> dialog: You want the frame
drawn as close as possible to the
<a href="widgets/YRadioButton-widget.html">RadioButtons</a>, not next to the
window frame with lots of empty space between the frame and the RadioButtons.
Use a squash widget for that purpose:

<a name="squash_example"></a>
<blockquote>
<pre>
`HVCenter(
          `HVSquash(
	            `Frame( "Select Software categories",
		           `VBox(
                                 ...
                                )
                          )
                   )
         )
</pre>
</blockquote>



<h3>Optical Grouping:
	<a name="frame"></a>
	<a href="widgets/YFrame-widget.html">Frame</a>
</h3>


<p>
This is not exactly a layout-only widget - you can see it. It is being
mentioned here more because like layout widgets it can have children.

<p>
Use a <a href="widgets/YFrame-widget.html">Frame</a> to visually group widgets
that logically belong together - such as the
<a href="widgets/YRadioButton-widget.html">RadioButtons</a> of a RadioBox or a
group of <a href="widgets/YCheckBox-widget.html">CheckBoxes</a> that have a
meaning in common (e.g. individual file permissions, software categories to
install, ...).


<p>
<b>Note:</b>
Do not overuse frames. They have a nice visual effect, but only if used
sparingly.


<p>
You may need to put a <a href="#squash">squash</a> widget around the frame in
order to avoid excessive empty space between the frame and its inner widgets.


<h4>Example:</h4>

See the <a href="#squash_example">squash example</a>.


<h3>Grouping RadioButtons:
	<a name="radiobuttongroup"></a>
	<a href="widgets/YRadioButtonGroup-widget.html">RadioButtonGroup</a>
</h3>


<p>
The <a href="widgets/YRadioButtonGroup-widget.html">RadioButtonGroup</a>
is a widget go logically group individual
<a href="widgets/YRadioButton-widget.html">RadioButton</a> widgets.
It does not have a visual effect or an effect on the layout.
All it does is to manage the one-out-of-many logic of a RadioBox: When one
<a href="widgets/YRadioButton-widget.html">RadioButton</a> is selected, all
the others in the same RadioBox (i.e. in the same RadioButtonGroup) must be
unselected.


<p>
Please notice that this might not be as trivial as it seems to be at first
glance: There might be some outer RadioBox that switches between several
general settings, enabling or disabling the others as necessary. Any of those
general settings might contain another RadioBox - which of course is
independent of the outer one. This is why you really need to specify the
RadioButtonGroup.


<p>
You usually just surround the
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">VBox</a> containing the
<a href="widgets/YRadioButton-widget.html">RadioButtons</a> with a
The <a href="widgets/YRadioButtonGroup-widget.html">RadioButtonGroup</a>.


<p>
Don't forget to include your RadioBox within a <a href="#frame">frame!</a>
<a href="widgets/YRadioButtonGroup-widget.html">RadioButtonGroup</a>,
<a href="widgets/YFrame-widget.html">Frame</a> and
<a href="widgets/YSquash-widget.html">HVSquash</a> usually all come together.


<h4>Example:</h4>


<a name="squash_example"></a>
<blockquote>
<pre width=100>
`HVCenter(
          `HVSquash(
	            `Frame( "Select Installation Type",

<h3>The Esoterics:
	<a name="replacepoint"></a>
	<a href="widgets/YReplacePoint-widget.html">ReplacePoint</a>
</h3>


<p>
A <a href="widgets/YReplacePoint-widget.html">ReplacePoint</a> is a "marker"
within the widget hierarchy of a layout. You can later refer to it with
<tt>ReplaceWidget()</tt>. Use this to cut out a part of the widget hierarchy
and paste some other sub-hierarchy to this point.


<p>
The YaST2 wizard dialogs use this a lot: The main window stays the same, just
some parts are replaced as needed - usually the large part to the right of the
help text, between the title bar and the "previous" and "next" buttons.


<p>
A ReplacePoint has no other visual or layout effect.


<h3>Obsolete: Split
	<a name="split"></a>
</h3>

<p>
This is not used any more. If you know anything about it, forget it. If you
don't, don't bother. It's old and obsolete and nobody used it anyway.

<h2>Common Layout Techniques
	<a name="common_techniques"></a>
</h2>


<p>
Use the case studies in this section as building blocks for your own
dialogs.


<p>
Remember that even though most of the examples use a horizontal layout
(a <a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">HBox</a>), the same rules and techniques
apply in the vertical dimension as well - just replace
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">HBox</a> with
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">VBox</a>,
<a href="widgets/YWeight-widget.html">HWeight</a> with
<a href="widgets/YWeight-widget.html">VWeight</a> etc.




<h3>Creating Widgets of Equal Size
	<a name="equal"></a>
</h3>


<p><img src="examples/screenshots/Layout-Buttons-Equal-Growing.png">
<p><i>
Screen shot of the
<a href="examples/Layout-Buttons-Equal-Growing.ycp">Layout-Buttons-Equal-Growing.ycp</a>
example</i>


<p>
You can easily make several widgets the same size - like in this example. Just
specify equal <a href="#weights">weights</a> for all widgets:

<blockquote>
<pre>

`HBox(
      `HWeight(1, `PushButton( "OK"                ) ),
      `HWeight(1, `PushButton( "Cancel everything" ) ),
      `HWeight(1, `PushButton( "Help"              ) )
     )

</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
The widgets will grow or shrink when resized. They will always retain equal sizes:


<p><img src="examples/screenshots/resized-larger/Layout-Buttons-Equal-Growing.png">
<p><i>The same example, resized larger.</i>
<br><br><br>

<p><img src="examples/screenshots/resized-smaller/Layout-Buttons-Equal-Growing.png">
<p><i>The same example, resized smaller.</i>
<br><br><br>





<h3>Creating Widgets of Equal Size that don't Grow
	<a name="equal_no_grow"></a>
</h3>


<p><img src="examples/screenshots/Layout-Buttons-Equal-Even-Spaced1.png">

<p><i>
Screen shot of the
<a href="examples/Layout-Buttons-Equal-Even-Spaced1.ycp">Layout-Buttons-Equal-Even-Spaced1.ycp</a>
example</i>


<p>
Widgets with a <a href="#weights">weight</a> (such as these buttons) are
implicitly stretchable. If you don't want the widgets to grow, insert
<a href="#rubber_bands">stretches</a> without any
<a href="#weights">weight</a> between them. They will take all excess
space - but <b>only if there is no <a href="#weights">weight</a> specified</b>
(otherwise, the <a href="#rubber_bands">stretches</a> would always maintain a
size according to the specified <a href="#weights">weight</a> - not what is
desired here).


<blockquote>
<pre>

`HBox(
      `HWeight(1, `PushButton( "OK"                ) ),
      `HStretch(),
      `HWeight(1, `PushButton( "Cancel everything" ) ),
      `HStretch(),
      `HWeight(1, `PushButton( "Help"              ) )
     )

</pre>
</blockquote>


<p><img src="examples/screenshots/resized-larger/Layout-Buttons-Equal-Even-Spaced1.png">
<p><i>The same example, resized larger.

<br><br><br>


<p><img src="examples/screenshots/resized-smaller/Layout-Buttons-Equal-Even-Spaced1.png">
<p><i>The same example, resized smaller.<br>
The stretches don't need any space if there is not enough space anyway.</i>
<br><br><br>



<h3>Creating Widgets of Equal Size that don't Grow - with Spacings in between
	<a name="equal_no_grow_spaced"></a>
</h3>


<p><img src="examples/screenshots/Layout-Buttons-Equal-Even-Spaced2.png">

<p><i>
Screen shot of the
<a href="examples/Layout-Buttons-Equal-Even-Spaced2.ycp">Layout-Buttons-Equal-Even-Spaced2.ycp</a>
example.<br>
Notice the spacing between the buttons.
</i>


<p>
If you want some space between the individual widgets, insert a
<a href="#spacings">spacing</a>. You could use both a
<a href="#spacings">spacing</a> and a
<a href="#rubber_bands">stretch</a>, but specifying the
<a href="#opt_stretch">stretchable</a> option for the
<a href="#spacings">spacing</a> will do the trick as well - and save some
unnecessary widgets:


<blockquote>
<pre>

`HBox(
      `HWeight(1, `PushButton( "OK"                ) ),
      `HSpacing(`opt(`hstretch), 3),
      `HWeight(1, `PushButton( "Cancel everything" ) ),
      `HSpacing(`opt(`hstretch), 3),
      `HWeight(1, `PushButton( "Help"              ) )
     )

</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
The value "3" used here for the <a href="#spacings"></a> is absolutely random,
chosen just for aesthetics. Use your own as appropriate.


<p><img src="examples/screenshots/resized-larger/Layout-Buttons-Equal-Even-Spaced2.png">
<p><i>The same example, resized larger.
Notice how the spacings take the excess space.</i>
<br><br><br>


<p><img src="examples/screenshots/resized-smaller/Layout-Buttons-Equal-Even-Spaced2.png">
<p><i>The same example, resized smaller.</i>

<p>
As you can see, the spacings have one disadvantage here: They need the space
you specified even if that means that there is not enough space for the other widgets.

<br><br><br>



<h3>Specifying the Size of Scrollable Widgets
	<a name="scrollable_sizes"></a>
</h3>


<p>
<a href="#nice_size">As mentioned before</a>,
most kinds of widgets that can scroll don't have a natural
<a href="#nice_size">nice size</a>. If the overall size of your layout is fixed
by some other means (e.g. because it is a
<a href="#defaultsize">full screen</a> dialog), you can have it take the
remaining space or specify proportions with
<a href="#weights">weights</a>.


<p>
If this is not the case, create such "other means" yourself: Surround the
scrollable widget with widgets of a well-defined size, e.g. with
<a href="#spacings">spacings</a>.


<p>
Prevent the <a href="#spacings">spacings</a> from
actually using precious screen space themselves by putting a
<a href="widgets/YSpacing-widget.html">VSpacing</a> in a
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">HBox</a> or a
<a href="widgets/YSpacing-widget.html">HSpacing</a> in a
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">VBox</a> - it will resize the corresponding
<a href="#layout_boxes">layout box</a> in its
<a href="#dimensions">secondary dimension</a>.
It will take no space in its
<a href="#dimensions">primary dimension</a>.


<h4>Example:</h4>

<blockquote>
<pre>

`VBox(
      `HSpacing(40),		// make the scrollable widget at least 40 units wide
      `HBox(
	    `VSpacing(10),	// make the scrollable widget at least 10 units high
	    `Table(...)		// or any other scrollable widget
           )
     )

</pre>
</blockquote>

<a href="examples/Table4.ycp">Table4.ycp</a> and
<a href="examples/Table5.ycp">Table5.ycp</a> examples.



<p>
As a general rule of thumb, use this technique whenever you place a scrollable
widget in a non-<a href="#defaultsize">defaultsize</a> dialog. Don't leave the
size of such widgets to pure coincidence - always explicitly specify their sizes.

<h2>Hints and Tips
	<a name="hints"></a>
</h2>



<h3>Debugging Aids: The Log File
	<a name="log_file"></a>
</h3>


<p>
<i>printf()</i> is your best friend when debugging - every seasoned programmer
knows that. YaST2 has something very much like that: <i>y2log()</i>, available
both in YCP and in the C++ sources. It is being used a lot, and you can add
your own in your YCP code. Thus, if something strange happens, check the log
file - either in your home directory (<tt>~/.y2log</tt>) or the system wide log
file (<tt>/var/log/y2log</tt>).


<p>
You can increase the level of verbosity by setting the <tt>Y2DEBUG</tt>
environment variable to 1 - both in your shell and at the boot prompt (for
debugging during an installation) - boot with something like


<blockquote>
<pre>
linux Y2DEBUG=1
</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>
Log files will be wrapped when they reach a certain size - i.e. the current log
file is renamed to <tt>~/.y2log-1</tt>, <tt>~/.y2log-2</tt> etc. or
<tt>/var/log/y2log-1</tt>, <tt>/var/log/y2log-2</tt> etc., and a new log file
is begun.


<h3>Keep it Simple - Do not Overcrowd Dialogs!
	<a name="dont_overcrowd"></a>
</h3>

<p>
If the layout engine complains about widgets not getting their <i>nice size</i>
and tell you to <i>check the layout</i>, please do that before you write a bug
report. More often than not that just means that your dialog is overcrowded.
That doesn't only raise technical problems: In that case your dialog most
likely is too complex and not likely to be understood by novice users. In
short, you very likely have a problem with your logical design, not with the
layout engine. Consider making it easier or splitting it up into several
dialogs - e.g. an easy-to-understand novice level base dialog and an advanced
"expert" dialog. Use YaST2's partitioning, software selection and LILO
configuration dialogs as examples for how to do this.


<p>
You might also consider replacing some widgets with others that don't use as
much screen space - e.g. use a ComboBox rather than a SelectionBox, or a
ComboBox rather than a RadioBox. But always keep in mind that this just reduces
screen space usage, not complexity. Plus, widgets like the ComboBox frequently
are harder to operate from a user's point of view because they require more
mouse clicks or keys presses to get anything done. Use with caution.



<h3>Always Keep Other UIs in Mind - What does it Look Like with NCurses?
	<a name="check_ncurses"></a>
</h3>

<p>
When you created a new dialog or substantially changed an existing one always
remember to check it with the other UIs, too. If it looks good with the Qt UI
that doesn't mean it looks good with the NCurses UI as well - it might even
break completely. There might be too many widgets or parts of widgets may be
invisible because of insufficient screen space.


<p>
If you don't like that idea always remember some day <em>you</em> might be that
poor guy who can't run YaST2 with Qt - maybe because of a brand new graphics
card the X server doesn't support yet or maybe because you have to install a
server system that just has a serial console.


<p>
The text based version may not need to look as good (but it would sure be nice
if it did), but it needs to work. That means all widgets must be there and be
visible. If they are not, you really need to rearrange or even redesign your
dialog. Possibly before somebody from the support department finds it out the
hard way - because a user complained badly about it.



<h3>Do not Neglect Mouseless Users - Always Provide Keyboard Shortcuts!
	<a name="keyboard_shortcuts"></a>
</h3>

<p>
Very much the same like the previous issue: Consider somebody who wants or
needs to operate your dialog without a mouse. Maybe he doesn't have one or
maybe it doesn't work - or maybe he uses the NCurses UI. There are even a lot
of users who can work a whole lot quicker if they can use keyboard shortcuts
for common tasks - e.g. activating buttons or jumping to text input fields. You
can and should provide keyboard shortcuts for each of those kinds of widgets.


<p>
Of course this needs to be double-checked with each of the translated versions:
Keyboard shortcuts not only are language dependent (so users can memorize
them), they are even contained within messages files. The translators need to
include their own in the respective language, and that means chances are some
of the sort cuts are double used - e.g. Alt-K may be used twice in the same
dialog, which renders the second use ineffective. Always check that, too.

<h2>The Layout Algorithm - How the Layout Engine Works Internally
	<a name="layout_algorithm"></a>
</h2>

<p>
You don't need to know the internals of the YaST2 UI layout engine in order to
be able to create YaST2 dialogs. But this kind of background knowledge
certainly helps a lot when you need to debug a layout - i.e. when a dialog you
programmed behaves "strange" and doesn't look at all like you expected.



<h3>Primary and Secondary Dimensions
	<a name="dimensions"></a>
</h3>


<p>
A <a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">HBox</a> lays out its children
horizontally, a
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">VBox</a> vertically. How they do that is
very much the same except for the dimensions: The HBox uses horizontal as its
<i>primary</i> dimension, the VBox vertical. The other dimension is called the
<i>secondary</i> dimension (vertical for the HBox, horizontal for the VBox).



<h3>Calculating the Nice Size
	<a name="calc_nice_size"></a>
</h3>



<h4>Secondary Nice Size
	<a name="sec_nice_size"></a>
</h4>


<p>
Calculating the <a href="#nice_size">nice size</a> in the
<a href="#dimensions">secondary dimension</a> is easy:
It is the maximum of the nice sizes of all children.
Thus, for a
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">HBox</a>
this is the nice height of the highest child, for a
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">VBox</a>
this is the nice width of the widest child.


<p>
If any child is a
<a href="#layout_boxes">layout box</a>
itself (or any other container widget), this process will become recursive for
the children of that layout box etc. - this holds true for both the
<a href="#dimensions">primary</a>
and the
<a href="#dimensions">secondary</a>
dimension.



<h4>Primary Nice Size
	<a name="prim_nice_size"></a>
</h4>


<p>
In the
<a href="#dimensions">primary</a>
dimension things are a bit more complicated:
First, the nice sizes of all children without
<a href="#weights">weights</a>
are summed up.


<p>
Then the sizes of all children with weights are added to that sum - in such a
way that each of those gets at least its nice size, yet all weights are
maintained with respect to each other. I.e. when a button is supposed to get
30% he must get it, but its label must still be completely visible.


<p>
Maybe some of the children with weights need to be resized larger because of
those restrictions. Exactly how large is calculated based on the so-called
<i>boss child</i>. This is the one widget that commands the overall size of all
children with weights, the one with

<blockquote>
max ( nice size / weight )
</blockquote>


<p>
The boss child's nice size and its weight determine the accumulated nice size
of all children with weights. The other children with weights will be
resized larger to get their share of that accumulated size according to their
individual weights.


<p>
By the way this is why all children with weights are implicitly
<a href="#opt_stretch">stretchable</a>
- most of them will be resized larger so the weights can be maintained at all
times.



<h3>Setting the Size of a Layout - SetSize()
	<a name="set_size"></a>
</h3>


<p>
Each widget has a SetSize() method. This will be called recursively for all
widgets from top (i.e. the outer dialog) to bottom. When a dialog is opened,
the UI determines how large a dialog should become. The UI tries to use the dialog's
<a href="#nice_size">nice size</a>, if possible - unless the
<a href="#defaultsize">defaultsize</a> option is set or the nice size exceeds
the screen size, in which case the screen size is used.


<p>
After the dialog is opened, the SetSize() method will be called again when:

<ul>
	<li>The user resizes a dialog.
	<li>A significant portion of the dialog changes - e.g. because of ReplaceWidget().
</ul>


<p>
All of those cases will cause a re-layout of the entire dialog.


<p>
For <a href="#layout_boxes">layout boxes</a>, the SetSize() method works like
this:


<p>
If none of the children of a layout box has a
<a href="#weights">weight</a>,
any extra space (i.e. space in excess of the
<a href="#nice_size">nice size)</a>
is evenly distributed among the
<a href="#opt_stretch">stretchable</a>
children. All non-stretchable children get their nice size, no more.


<p>
If there are not any
<a href="#opt_stretch">stretchable</a>
children, there will be empty space at the end of the layout (i.e. to the right
for a
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">HBox</a>
and at the bottom of a
<a href="widgets/Box-widget.html">VBox</a>).

If any child has a
<a href="#weights">weight</a>,
all children without weights will get no more than their nice sizes - no matter
whether or not they are
<a href="#opt_stretch">stretchable</a>.


<p>
The rest of the space will be distributed among the children with weights
according to the individual weights.

<p>
There is one exception to that rule, however:
If there is more space than the weighted childrens' nice size and there are any
<a href="#rubber_bands">stretches</a> or stretchable
<a href="#spacings">spacings</a> without weights,
the excess space will be evenly distributed among them.


<p>
This may sound like a <i>very</i> pathological case, but in fact only this
gives the application programmer a chance to create
<a href="#equal_no_grow">equal sized widgets that don't grow</a>,
maybe
<a href="#equal_no_grow_spaced">with a little extra space between them</a>.
Simple popup dialogs with some buttons are typical examples for this, and this
is quite common.



<h4>Running out of Space - the Pathological Cases
	<a name="out_of_space"></a>
</h4>


<p>
There should be enough space for any layout box: By default, the overall size
of a dialog is calculated based on its
<a href="#nice_size">nice size</a>.

But this might exceed the
<a href="#defaultsize">full screen size</a>,
or the user might manually have resized the dialog (some UIs are capable of
that) - both of which cases will cause a dialog to get less than its nice size.


<p>
If there is not enough space, the layout engine will complain about that fact
in the <a href="#log_file">log file</a>, asking you to "check the
layout". Please do that if this message <i>always</i> appears when a certain
dialog is opened - you may have to rearrange your dialog so all widgets
properly fit into it.

<p>
Anyway, if it happens, some widgets will get less than their nice size and
probably will not look good; some might even be completely invisible.


<p>
Even then, as long as there is enough space for all children without <a
href="#weights">weights</a>, those will get their nice sizes. Only the
remaining space will be distributed among the children with weights.


<p>
If the space isn't even enough for the children without weights, each of them
will have to spend some of its space to make up for the loss. The layout engine
tries to treat each of them equally bad, i.e. each of them has to give some
space.




<h4>Centering in the Secondary Dimension
	<a name="centering_secondary"></a>
</h4>

If there is too much space in the secondary dimension and a child cannot be
resized larger to take this space (because it isn't
<a href="#opt_stretch">stretchable</a>
), it will be centered.

<p>
This behaviour may be somewhat unexpected, but not only is this compatible with
older versions of the YaST2
<a href="#ui">UI</a>,
it also comes very handy for simple layout tasks like this
(taken from the
<a href="examples/Label1.ycp">Label1.ycp</a>
example):

<blockquote>
<pre>

`VBox(
      `Label( "Hello, world" ),
      `PushButton( "OK" )
     )

</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
This button will be centered horizontally - without the need for a
<a href="widgets/YAlignment-widget.html">HCenter</a>
around it.
