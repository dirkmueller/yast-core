            <section id="UI-Event-Intro-classic_gui"><title>Classic GUI Event
                    Loops</title>

                <para>Classic graphical user interface (GUI) programming is almost
                    always event-driven: The application initializes, creates its
                    dialog(s) and then spends most of its time in one central event
                    loop.</para>

                <para>When the user clicks on a button or enters text in an input
                    field, he generates <emphasis role="i">events</emphasis>. The underlying GUI toolkit
                    provides mechanisms so the application can react to those events -
                    perform an action upon button click, store the characters the user
                    typed etc.; all this is done from <emphasis role="i">callback</emphasis> functions of one
                    kind or the other (whatever they may be called in the respective
                    GUI toolkit).</para>

                <para>In any case, it all comes down to one single event loop in the
                    application from where small functions (let's call them
                    <emphasis role="i">callbacks</emphasis> for the sake of simplicity) are called when events
                    occur. Those callbacks each contain a small amount of the
                    application's GUI logic to do whatever is to be done when the
                    respective event occurs. The overall application logic is scattered
                    among them all.</para>

                <para>This approach is called <emphasis role="i">event-driven</emphasis>. Most GUI toolkits
                    have adopted it.</para>

                <para>Depending on the primary goal of a GUI application, this
                    event-driven approach may or may not be appropriate. It is
                    perfectly suitable for example for word processor applications, for
                    web browsers or for most other GUI applications that have one
                    central main window the user works with most of his time: The user
                    is the driving force behind those kinds of applications; only he
                    knows what he next wishes to do. The application has no workflow in
                    itself.</para>

                <para>Thus the event-driven application model fits perfectly here: The
                    callbacks can easily be self-contained; there is little context
                    information, and there are limited application-wide data.</para>

            </section>
            <section id="UI-Event-Intro-y2_approach"><title>The YaST2 Approach</title>

                <para>Applications like YaST2 with all its installation and
                    configuration workflows, however, are radically different. The
                    driving force here is the application workflow, the sequence of
                    dialogs the user is presented with.</para>

                <para>Of course this can be modeled with a traditional event loop, but
                    doing that considerably adds to the complexity of the application:
                    Either the application needs a lot more callbacks, or the callbacks
                    need to keep track of a lot of status information (workflow step
                    etc.) - or both.</para>

                <para>For the YaST2 UI, a different approach was chosen: Rather than
                    having one central event loop and lots of callbacks, the flow
                    control remains in the interpreted YCP code. User input is
                    requested on demand - very much like in simplistic programming
                    languages like the first versions of BASIC.</para>

                <para>This of course means that there is no single one central
                    "waiting point" in the program (like the event loop in the
                    event-driven model), but rather lots of such waiting points spread
                    all over the YCP code within each <link
                        linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> or
                    <link linkend="UI-Event-WaitForEvent">WaitForEvent()</link>
                    statement.</para>

                <para>Side note: Of course a graphical UI like the
                    YaST2 Qt UI still has to be prepared to perform screen redraws
                    whenever the underlying window system requires that - i.e. whenever
                    X11 sends an <emphasis role="i">Expose</emphasis> (or similar) event. For this purpose the
                    Qt UI is multi-threaded: One thread takes care of X event handling,
                    one thread is the actual YCP UI interpreter. This instant screen
                    redraw is what you lose when you invoke <emphasis role="i">y2base</emphasis> with the
                    "--nothreads" command line option.</para>

                <para>YCP was meant to be an easy-to-understand programming language
                    for developers who specialize in a particular aspect of system
                    configuration or installation, not in GUI programming.</para>

                <para>Practical experience with all the YaST2 modules developed so far
                    has shown that application developers tend to adopt this concept of
                    <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> very
                    easily. On the other hand it is a widely known fact that
                    event-driven GUI programming means a steep learning curve because
                    (as mentioned before) it requires splitting up the application
                    logic into tiny pieces for all the callbacks.</para>

                <para>Thus, this design decision of YaST2 seems to have proven right
                    much more often than there are problems with its downsides (which
                    of course also exist).</para>

            </section>
            <section id="UI-Event-Intro-simplicity"><title>Simplicity vs. Features</title>

                <para>The basic idea of YaST2 UI programming is to create a dialog
                    asking the user for some data and then continue with the next such
                    dialog - meaning that most of those dialogs are basically forms to
                    be filled in with an "OK" (or "Next") and a "Cancel" (or "Back")
                    button. The YCP application is usually interested only in those
                    button presses, not in each individual keystroke the user
                    performs.</para>

                <para>This is why by default <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> and related
                    functions react to little more than button presses - i.e. they
                    ignore all other events, in particular low-level events the widgets
                    handle all by themselves like keystrokes (this is the input fields'
                    job) or selecting items in selection boxes, tables or similar. Most
                    YCP applications simply don't need or even want to know anything
                    about that.</para>

                <para>This makes YCP UI programming pretty simple. The basic principle
                    looks like this:</para>

                <programlisting>
{
    UI::OpenDialog(
            `VBox(
                ... // Some input fields etc.
                `HBox(
                    `PushButton(`id(`back ), "Back" ),
                    `PushButton(`id(`next ), "Next" )
                    )
                )
            );

    symbol button_id = UI::UserInput();

    if ( button_id == `next )
    {
        // Handle "Next" button
    }
    else if ( button_id == `back )
    {
        // Handle "Back" button
    }

    UI::CloseDialog();
}
                </programlisting>

                <para>Strictly spoken, you don't even require a loop around that -
                    even though this is very useful and thus strongly advised.</para>

                <para>All that can make <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> return in this
                    example are the two buttons. Other widgets like input
                    fields ( <link linkend="TextEntry_widget">TextEntry</link>), selection
                    boxes etc. by do not do anything that makes <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> return -
                    unless explicitly requested.</para>

            </section>

            <section id="UI-Event-Intro-notify"><title>The <emphasis role="i">notify</emphasis> Option</title>

                <para>
                    If a YCP application is interested in events that occur in a
                    widget other than a button, the <emphasis
                        role="i">notify</emphasis> widget option can be used
                    when creating it with <literal>UI::OpenDialog()</literal>.</para>

                <example><title>The notify option</title>

                    <programlisting>
UI::OpenDialog(...
  `SelectionBox(`id(`pizza ), `opt(`notify ), ... ),
   ...
  `Table(`id(`toppings), `opt(`notify, `immediate ), ... ),
  ...
)
                    </programlisting>

                    <para>In general, the <emphasis role="i">notify</emphasis> options makes <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> return when
                        something "important" happens to that widget. The <emphasis role="i">immediate</emphasis>
                        option (always in combination with <emphasis role="i">notify</emphasis>!) makes the widget
                        even more "verbose".</para>

                    <para><emphasis role="b">Note:</emphasis> <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> always returns
                        the ID of the widget that caused an event. You cannot tell the
                        difference when many different types of event could have occured.
                        This is why there are different levels of verbosity with
                        <emphasis role="i">`opt(`notify )</emphasis> or
                        <emphasis role="i">`opt(`notify, `immediate )</emphasis> and the new <link linkend="UI-Event-WaitForEvent">WaitForEvent()</link> UI
                        builtin function which returns more detailed
                        information. A <link linkend="Table_widget">Table</link> widget for example
                        can generate both <link linkend="Activated">Activated</link> and <link linkend="SelectionChanged">SelectionChanged</link>
                        <link linkend="WidgetEvent">WidgetEvents</link>.</para>

                    <para>Exactly what makes <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> return for
                        each widget class is described in full detail in the
                        <link linkend="Event_Reference">YaST2 event reference</link>.</para>

                </example>
            </section>
            <section id="UI-Event-Intro-downsides"><title>Downsides and Discussions</title>

                <para>The YaST2 event handling model has been (and will probably
                    always remain) a subject of neverending discussions. Each and every
                    new team member and everybody who casually writes a YaST2 module
                    (to configure the subsystem that is his real responsibility) feels
                    compelled to restart this discussion.</para>

                <para>The idea of having a function called <emphasis role="i">UserInput()</emphasis> seems to
                    conjure up ghastly memories of horrible times that we hoped to have
                    overcome: The days of home-computer era BASIC programming or
                    university Pascal lectures (remember Pascal's <emphasis role="i">readln()</emphasis>?) or
                    even low-tech primitive C programs (<emphasis role="i">gets()</emphasis> or <emphasis role="i">scanf()</emphasis>
                    are not better, either).</para>

                <para>But it's not quite like that. Even though the function name is
                    similar, the concept is radically different: It is not just one
                    single value that is being read, it is a whole dialog full of
                    whatever widgets you see fit to put there. All the widgets take
                    care of themselves; they all handle their values automatically. You
                    just have to ask them (<link linkend="YUI_builtins">UI::QueryWidget()</link>) for the
                    values when you need them (leave them alone as long as you
                    don't).</para>

                <para>The similarity with computing stone age remains, however, in
                    that you have to explicitly call <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> or related
                    when you need user input. If you don't, you open your dialog, and a
                    moment later when you continue in your code it closes again - with
                    little chance for the user to enter anything.</para>

                <para>Thus, the YaST2 approach has its intrinsic formalisms in that
                    sequence:</para>

                <programlisting>
OpenDialog(...);

UserInput();
QueryWidget(...);
QueryWidget(...);
QueryWidget(...);
...

CloseDialog();

                </programlisting>

                <para>This is the price to pay for this level of simplicity.</para>

            <section id="UI-Event-Intro-design_alternatives"><title>Design Alternatives</title>

                <para>In the course of those <link linkend="UI-Event-Intro-downsides">discussions</link> some
                    design alternatives began to emerge:</para>

                <orderedlist spacing="compact"><listitem><para>Use the single-event-loop and callback model like most other
                            toolkits.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Keep multiple event loops (like <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link>), but add
                            callbacks to individual widget events when needed so the YCP
                            application can do some more fine-grained control of individual
                            events.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Keep multiple event loops, but return more information than
                            this simplistic <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> that can
                            return no more than one single ID.</para></listitem></orderedlist>

                <para>Having just a single event loop would not really solve any
                    problem, but create a lot of new ones: A sequence of <emphasis role="i">wizard</emphasis>
                    style dialogs would be really hard to program. Switching back and
                    forth between individual wizard dialogs would have to be moved into
                    some callbacks, and a lot of status data for them all to share
                    (which dialog, widget status etc.) would have to be made
                    global.</para>

                <para>What a mess. We certainly don't want that.</para>

                <para>All the callback-driven models have one thing in common: Most of
                    the application logic would have to be split up and moved into the
                    callbacks. The sequence of operations would be pretty much
                    invisible to the application developer, thus the logical workflow
                    would be pretty much lost.</para>

                <para>Most who discussed that agreed that we don't want that, too.</para>

                <para>Add to that the formalisms that would be required for having
                    callbacks: Either add a piece of callback code (at least a function
                    name) to <emphasis role="i">UI::OpenDialog()</emphasis> for each widget that should get
                    callbacks or provide a new UI builtin function like, say,
                    <emphasis role="i">UI::SetCallback()</emphasis> or <emphasis role="i">UI::AddCallback()</emphasis> that gets a
                    YCP map that specifies at least the widget to add the callback to,
                    the event to react to and the code (or at least a function name) to
                    execute and some transparent <emphasis role="i">client data</emphasis> where the
                    application can pass arbitrary data to the callback to keep the
                    amount of required global data down.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="i">UI::RemoveCallback()</emphasis></para>
                <para>It might look about like this:</para>

                <programlisting>
define void selectionChanged( any widgetID, map event, any clientData ) {
   ...
   // Handle SelectionChanged event
   ...
};

define void activated( any widgetID, map event, any clientData ) {
   ...
   // Handle Activated event
   ...
};

...
UI::OpenDialog(
   ...
   `Table(`id(`devices ), ... ),
   ...
);
...
UI::AddCallback(`id(`devices ), `SelectionChanged, nil );
UI::AddCallback(`id(`devices ), `Activated, nil );

                </programlisting>

                <para>If you think "oh, that doesn't look all too bad", think twice.
                    This example is trivial, yet there are already three separate
                    places that address similar things:</para>

                <itemizedlist spacing="compact"><listitem><para>The callback definitions. Agreed, you'll need some kind of code
                            that actually does the application's business somewhere anyway. But
                            chances are that the callbacks are no more than mere wrappers that
                            call the functions that actually do the application's operations.
                            You don't want to mix up all the back engine code with the UI
                            related stuff.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Widget creation with <emphasis role="i">UI::OpenDialog()</emphasis></para></listitem><listitem><para>Adding callbacks with <emphasis role="i">UI::AddCallback()</emphasis></para></listitem></itemizedlist>

                <para>A lot of GUI toolkits do it very much this way - most Xt based
                    toolkits for example (OSF/Motif, Athena widgets, ...). But this
                    used to be a source of constant trouble: Change a few things here
                    and be sure that revenge will come upon you shortly. It simply adds
                    to the overall complexity of something that is already complex
                    enough - way enough.</para>

                <para>Bottom line: Having callbacks is not really an
                    improvement.
                </para>

                <para>What remains is to stick to the general model of YaST2 but
                    return more information - of course while remaining compatible with
                    existing YCP code. We don't want (neither can we economically
                    afford to) break all existing YCP code. So the existing UI builtin
                    functions like <link
                        linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> or <link
                        linkend="UI-Event-PollInput">PollInput()</link> have to remain
                    exactly the same. But of course we can easily add a completely new
                    UI builtin function that does return more information.</para>

                <para>This is what we did. This is how <link linkend="UI-Event-WaitForEvent">WaitForEvent()</link> came
                    into existence. It behaves like <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link>, but it
                    returns more information about what really happened - in the form
                    of an event <emphasis role="i">map</emphasis> rather than just a single ID. That map
                    contains that ID (of course) plus <link linkend="Eventmaps">additional data</link> depending
                    on the event that occured.</para>

                <para>One charming advantage of just adding another UI builtin is that
                    existing code does not need to be touched at all. Only if you want
                    to take advantage of the additional information returned by <link linkend="UI-Event-WaitForEvent">WaitForEvent()</link> you need
                    to do anything at all.</para>

                <para>So let's all hope with this approach we found a compromise we
                    all can live with. While that probably will not prevent
                    <link linkend="UI-Event-Intro-downsides">those discussions</link> by new team members, maybe
                    it will calm down the current team members' discussion a bit.

            <section id="UI-Event-Intro-queues"><title>Event Queues vs. One Single
                    Pending Event</title>

                <para>Since the YaST2 UI doesn't have a single <link
                        linkend="UI-Event-Intro-classic_gui">event loop</link> where the program spends most of
                    its time, an indefinite period of time may pass between causing an
                    event (e.g., the user clicks on a widget) and event <emphasis role="i">delivery</emphasis>
                    - the time where the (YCP) application actually receives the event
                    and begins processing it. That time gap depends on exactly when the
                    YCP code executes the next <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> etc.
                    statement.</para>

                <para>This of course means that events that occured in the mean time
                    need to be stored somewhere for the YCP code to pick them up with
                    <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> etc.</para>

                <para>The first approach that automatically comes to mind is "use a
                    queue and deliver them first-in, first-out". But this brings along
                    its own problems:</para>

                <para>Events are only useful in the context of the dialog they belong
                    to. When an event's dialog is closed or when a new dialog is opened
                    on top of that event's dialog (a popup for example) it doesn't make
                    any more sense to handle that event. Even worse, it will usually
                    lead to utter confusion, maybe even damage.</para>

                <para>Imagine this situation: The user opens a YaST2 partitioning
                    module just to have a look at his current partitioning scheme.</para>

                <para>Side note: This scenario is fictious. The real
                    YaST2 partitioning module is not like that. Any similarities with
                    present or past partitioning modules or present or past YaST2
                    hackers or users is pure coincidence and not intended. Ah yes, and
                    no animals were harmed in the process of making that scenario.
                    ;-)</para>

                        <para>The initialization is done. Usually, the YCP code would now
                            reach <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> and
                            ueued events would be delivered (remember, this is only a fictious
                            scenario - the UI does not really do that). The first "OK" click
                            from the queue is delivered - i.e. <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> returns
                            `ok.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            But this doesn't happen this time: The initialization code found
                            out that something might be wrong with the partitioning or file
                            systems. It might make sense to convert, say, the mounted

                <para>Argh. What a mess.</para>

                <para>Yes, this example is contrived. But it shows the general
                    problem: Events belong to one specific dialog. It never makes any
                    sense to deliver events to other dialogs.</para>

                <para>But this isn't all. Even if the internal UI engine (the
                    <emphasis role="i">libyui</emphasis>) could make sure that events are only delivered to
                    the dialog they belong to (maybe with a separate queue for each
                    dialog), events may never blindly be taken from any queue. If the
                    user typed (or clicked) a lot ahead, disaster scenarios similar to
                    the one described above might occur just as well.</para>

                <para>Events are context specific. The dialog they belong to is not
                    their only context; they also depend on the application logic (i.e.
                    on YCP code). This is another byproduct of the <link
                        linkend="UI-Event-Intro-y2_approach">YaST2 event handling approach</link>.</para>

                <para>It has been suggested to use (per-dialog) event queues, but to
                    flush their contents when the dialog context changes:</para>

                <itemizedlist spacing="compact"><listitem><para>When a new dialog is opened (<emphasis role="i">OpenDialog()</emphasis>)</para></listitem><listitem><para>When the current dialog is closed (<emphasis role="i">CloseDialog()</emphasis>)</para></listitem><listitem><para>When parts of the dialog are replaced

                <para>Exactly when and how this should happen is unclear. Every
                    imaginable way has its downsides or some pathologic scenarios. You
                    just can't do this right. And YCP application developers would have
                    to know when and how this happens - which is clearly nothing they
                    should be troubled with.</para>

                <para>This is why <emphasis role="b">all current YaST2 UIs have onle one single
                        <emphasis role="i">pending event</emphasis> and not a queue of events.</emphasis> When a new
                    event occurs, it usually overwrites any event that may still be
                    pending - i.e. events get lost if there are too many of them (more
                    than the YCP application can and wants to handle).</para>

                            sense anyway. After that the user has to wait for the next dialog
                            to answer more questions. It does not make any sense to queue
                            events here; the context in the next dialog is different

                    If the user clicks faster than the application can handle, don't
                    simply count those events to find out what to do. Always treat that
                    as a hint to find out what exactly happened: Ask the widgets about
                    their current status. They know best. They are what the user sees
                    on the screen. Don't surprise the user with other values than what
                    he can see on-screen.</para>

                <para>In the past, some widgets that accepted initially selected items
                    upon creation had sometimes triggered events for that initial
                    selection, sometimes not. Even though it is a performance
                    optimization goal of the UI to suppress such program-generated
                    events, it cannot be taken for granted if they occur or not. But
                    it's easy not to rely on that. Instead of writing code like

                <para>It's that easy. This small change can make code reliable or
                    subject to failure on minor outside changes - like a version of the

                        WidgetEvents</link> - or does not send that signal any more like

                <para>Being sceptical and not believing anything, much less taking
                    anything for granted is an attitude that most programmers adopt as

                <para>Keep it that way. It's a healthy attitude. It helps to avoid a

            <para>A <emphasis role="i">SelectionChanged</emphasis> <link linkend="SelectionChanged">WidgetEvent</link> is sent by most widgets that
                have the concept of a "selected item" like <link linkend="SelectionBox_widget">SelectionBox</link>, <link linkend="Table_widget">Table</link>, or <link linkend="Tree_widget">Tree</link> when the selected item
                changes.</para>

            <para>Note that the <link linkend="MultiSelectionBox_widget">MultiSelectionBox</link>
                widget can send a <emphasis role="i">SelectionChanged</emphasis> event, but also a <link linkend="ValueChanged">ValueChanged WidgetEvent</link> depending on what
                the user did. This is one reason to keep <emphasis role="i">SelectionChanged</emphasis>
                and <link linkend="ValueChanged">ValueChanged</link> two distinct events:
                Widgets can have both concepts which may be equally important,
                depending on the YCP application.</para>

            <para>The <link linkend="ComboBox_widget">ComboBox</link>
                never sends a <emphasis role="i">SelectionChanged</emphasis> event. It only sends <link linkend="ValueChanged">ValueChanged WidgetEvents</link>.</para>

            <para>The rationale behind this is that merely opening the drop-down
                list without actually accepting one of its items is just a
                temporary operation in a separate pop-up window (the drop-down
                list) that should not affect the YCP application or other widgets
                in the same dialog until the user actually accepts a value - upon
                which event a <link linkend="ValueChanged">ValueChanged WidgetEvent</link>
                is sent.</para>

            <para>A CancelEvent is an event that is sent when the user performs a

            <para>For the <emphasis role="b">Qt UI</emphasis>, this means he used the window manager

                hit the ESC key.</para>

            <para><emphasis role="b">User interface style hint:</emphasis> It is usually
                a good idea for each dialog to provide some kind of "safe exit"
                anyway. Most popup dialogs (at least those that have more than just
                a simple "OK" button) should provide a "Cancel" button. If you use
                the widget ID `cancel for that button, CancelEvents integrate
                seamlessly into your YCP application.
            </para>
            <para>
                "Main window" type dialogs should have an "Abort" button or
                something similar. If you don't use the widget ID `cancel for that
                button, don't forget to handle `cancel or "CancelEvent" like that
                "Abort" button. The user should always have a safe way out of a
                dialog - preferably one that doesn't change anything. Don't forget
                to add a confirmation popup before you really exit if there are
                unsaved data that might get lost!</para>

            <para>KeyEvents are specific to the NCurses UI. They are not intended
                for general usage. The idea is to use them where the default
                keyboard focus handling is insufficient - for example, when the
                logical layout of a dialog is known and the keyboard focus should
                be moved to the logically right widget upon pressing the <emphasis role="i">cursor
                    right</emphasis> key.</para>

            <para>Widgets deliver KeyEvents if they have <literal>`opt( keyEvent )</literal>
                set. This is independent of the <link linkend="UI-Event-Intro-notify">notify option</link>.</para>

            <para>It is completely up to the UI what key presses are delivered as
                key events. Never rely on each and every key press to be
                delivered.</para>

                                retrieve the key symbol: No other events than KeyEvent have this

                                    markers ("&amp;"), maybe abbreviated to a reasonable length.</para>

                                <para>This label is translated to the current locale (the current
                                    user's language).</para>

                                <para>This is intended for debugging so you can easily dump something
                                    into the log file when you get an event.</para>

                                <para>Wigets that don't have a label don't add this field to the event
                                    map, so make sure you use a reasonable default when using a map
                                    lookup for this field: Don't use <emphasis role="i">nil</emphasis>, use "" (the emtpy

            <para>Even though at first glance the KeyEvent map looks very much
                like the <link linkend="WidgetEvent">WidgetEvent</link>'s map, it is
                different in how the "ID" field is used: A KeyEvent uses it to
                return the key symbol, while a <link linkend="WidgetEvent">WidgetEvent</link> returns the widget ID. This is
                intended to integrate more seamlessly with common usage of <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link>: A YCP application
                can simply use <link linkend="UI-Event-UserInput">UserInput()</link> and check for a
                return value "CursorRight" etc. - which should not cause any
                trouble unless somebody uses this as a (badly chosen) widget
                ID.</para>

            <para>A DebugEvent is an event type especially intended for debugging
                YCP code. It is sent when the user presses a special key
                combination.</para>

            <para>For the <emphasis role="b">Qt UI</emphasis>, this event is sent upon pressing
                Alt-Ctrl-Shift-D. There is currently no such key combination in the
                <emphasis role="b">NCurses UI</emphasis>.</para>

            <para>Use DebugEvents event to dump additional data
                to the log file or to open special debugging popup dialogs - but
                <emphasis role="b">never</emphasis> do anything with it that might turn out to be a
                security hazard. Remember, even though the key combination is
                really awkward, sooner or later some users will get to know it, and
                they will experiment.</para>
