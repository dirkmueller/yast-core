<h1><a name="y2_model">The YaST2 Event Model</a></h1>

<h2><a name="classic_gui">Classic GUI Event Loops</a></h2>

<p>
Classic graphical user interface (GUI) programming is almost always
event-driven: The application initializes, creates its dialog(s) and then
spends most of its time in one central event loop.
<p>
When the user clicks on a button or enters text in an input field, he generates
<i>events</i>. The underlying GUI toolkit provides mechanisms so the
application can react to those events - perform an action upon button click,
store the characters the user typed etc.; all this is done from <i>callback</i>
functions of one kind or the other (whatever they may be called in the
respective GUI toolkit).
<p>
In any case, it all comes down to one single event loop in the application from
where small functions (let's call them <i>callbacks</i> for the sake of
simplicity) are called when events occur. Those callbacks each contain a small
amount of the application's GUI logic to do whatever is to be done when the
respective event occurs. The overall application logic is scattered among
them all.
<p>
This approach is called <i>event-driven</i>. Most GUI toolkits have adopted it.
<p>
Depending on the primary goal of a GUI application, this event-driven approach
may or may not be appropriate. It is perfectly suitable for example for word
processor applications, for web browsers or for most other GUI applications
that have one central main window the user works with most of his time: The
user is the driving force behind those kinds of applications; only he knows
what he next wishes to do. The application has no workflow in itself.
<p>
Thus the event-driven application model fits perfectly here: The callbacks can
easily be self-contained; there is little context information, and there are
limited application-wide data.



<h2><a name="y2_approach">The YaST2 Approach</a></h2>

<p>
Applications like YaST2 with all its installation and configuration workflows,
however, are radically different. The driving force here is the application
workflow, the sequence of dialogs the user is presented with.
<p>
Of course this can be modeled with a traditional event loop, but doing that
considerably adds to the complexity of the application: Either the application
needs a lot more callbacks, or the callbacks need to keep track of a lot of
status information (workflow step etc.) - or both.
<p>
For the YaST2 UI, a different approach was chosen: Rather than having one
central event loop and lots of callbacks, the flow control remains in the
interpreted YCP code. User input is requested on demand - very much like in
simplistic programming languages like the first versions of BASIC.
<p>
This of course means that there is no single one central "waiting point" in the
program (like the event loop in the event-driven model), but rather lots of such
waiting points spread all over the YCP code within each
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a> or
<a href="event-builtins.html#WaitForEvent">WaitForEvent()</a>
statement.

<p class="info-box">
Side note: Of course a graphical UI like the YaST2 Qt UI still has to be
prepared to perform screen redraws whenever the underlying window system
requires that - i.e. whenever X11 sends an <i>Expose</i> (or similar)
event. For this purpose the Qt UI is multi-threaded: One thread takes care of
X event handling, one thread is the actual YCP UI interpreter. This instant
screen redraw is what you lose when you invoke <i>y2base</i> with the
"--nothreads" command line option.
</p>

<p>
YCP was meant to be an easy-to-understand programming language for developers
who specialize in a particular aspect of system configuration or
installation, not in GUI programming.
<p>
Practical experience with all the YaST2 modules developed so far has shown that
application developers tend to adopt this concept of
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>
very easily. On the other hand it is a widely known fact that event-driven GUI
programming means a steep learning curve because (as mentioned before) it
requires splitting up the application logic into tiny pieces for all the
callbacks. 
<p>
Thus, this design decision of YaST2 seems to have proven right much more often
than there are problems with its downsides (which of course also exist).


<h2><a name="simplicity">Simplicity vs. Features</a></h2>

<p>
The basic idea of YaST2 UI programming is to create a dialog asking the user
for some data and then continue with the next such dialog - meaning that most
of those dialogs are basically forms to be filled in with an "OK" (or "Next")
and a "Cancel" (or "Back") button. The YCP application is usually interested
only in those button presses, not in each individual keystroke the user
performs.
<p>
This is why by default
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>
and related functions react to little more than button presses - i.e. they
ignore all other events, in particular low-level events the widgets handle all
by themselves like keystrokes (this is the input fields' job) or selecting
items in selection boxes, tables or similar. Most YCP applications simply don't
need or even want to know anything about that.
<p>
This makes YCP UI programming pretty simple. The basic principle looks like this:

<pre class="code">
<b>UI::OpenDialog</b>(
               `VBox(
                     ... // Some input fields etc.
                     `HBox(
                           `PushButton(`id(`back ), "Back" ),
                           `PushButton(`id(`next ), "Next" )
                          )
                     )
              );

symbol button_id = <b>UI::UserInput()</b>;

if ( button_id == `next )
{
    // Handle "Next" button
}
else if ( button_id == `back )
{
    // Handle "Back" button
}

<b>UI::CloseDialog()</b>;

</pre>

<p>
Strictly spoken, you don't even require a loop around that - even though this
is very useful and thus strongly advised.
<p>
All that can make
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>
return in this example are the two buttons. Other widgets like input fields (
<a href="../widgets/YTextEntry-widget.html">TextEntry</a>), selection boxes
etc. by do not do anything that makes
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>
return - unless explicitly requested.



<h2><a name="notify">The <i>notify</i> Option</a></h2>

<p>
If a YCP application is interested in events that occur in a widget other than
a button, the <i>notify</i>
<a href="../widgets/YWidget-widget.html">widget option</a>
can be used when creating it with UI::OpenDialog().

<h3>Example:</h3>

<pre class="code">
<b>UI::OpenDialog</b>(...
               `SelectionBox(`id(`pizza ), <em>`opt(`notify )</em>, ... ),
               ...
               `Table(`id(`toppings), <em>`opt(`notify, `immediate )</em>, ... ),
               ...
               )
</pre>

<p>
In general, the <i>notify</i> options makes
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>
return when something "important" happens to that widget.
The <i>immediate</i> option (always in combination with <i>notify</i>!)
makes the widget even more "verbose".

<p class="info-box">
<b>Note:</b>
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>
always returns the ID of the widget that caused an event. You cannot tell the
difference when many different types of event could have occured. This is why
there are different levels of verbosity with <i>`opt(`notify&nbsp;)</i> or
<i>`opt(`notify,&nbsp;`immediate&nbsp;)</i> and the new
<a href="event-builtins.html#WaitForEvent">WaitForEvent()</a> UI builtin
function which returns more detailed information. A
<a href="../widgets/YTable-widget.html">Table</a>
widget for example can generate both
<a href="event-reference.html#Activated">Activated</a> and
<a href="event-reference.html#SelectionChanged">SelectionChanged</a>
<a href="event-reference.html#WidgetEvent">WidgetEvents</a>.
</p>

<p>
Exactly what makes
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>
return for each widget class is described in full detail in the
<a href="event-reference.html">YaST2 event reference</a>.



<h2><a name="downsides">Downsides and Discussions</a></h2>

<p>
The YaST2 event handling model has been (and will probably always remain) a
subject of neverending discussions. Each and every new team member and
everybody who casually writes a YaST2 module (to configure the subsystem that is
his real responsibility) feels compelled to restart this discussion.
<p>
The idea of having a function called <i>UserInput()</i> seems to conjure up
ghastly memories of horrible times that we hoped to have overcome: The days of
home-computer era BASIC programming or university Pascal lectures (remember
Pascal's <i>readln()</i>?) or even low-tech primitive C programs (<i>gets()</i>
or <i>scanf()</i> are not better, either).
<p>
But it's not quite like that. Even though the function name is similar, the
concept is radically different: It is not just one single value that is being
read, it is a whole dialog full of whatever widgets you see fit to put
there. All the widgets take care of themselves; they all handle their values
automatically. You just have to ask them
(<a href="../YCP-builtins-ui.html">UI::QueryWidget()</a>)
for the values when you need them (leave them alone as long as you don't).
<p>
The similarity with computing stone age remains, however, in that you have to
explicitly call
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>
or related when you need user input. If you don't, you open your dialog, and a
moment later when you continue in your code it closes again - with little
chance for the user to enter anything.
<p>
Thus, the YaST2 approach has its intrinsic formalisms in that sequence:

<pre class="code">
OpenDialog(...);

UserInput();
QueryWidget(...);
QueryWidget(...);
QueryWidget(...);
...

CloseDialog();

</pre>

<p>
This is the price to pay for this level of simplicity.



<h2><a name="design_alternatives">Design Alternatives</a></h2>

<p>
In the course of those
<a href="#downsides">discussions</a>
some design alternatives began to emerge:

<ol>

<li>
Use the single-event-loop and callback model like most other toolkits.
</li>

<li>
Keep multiple event loops (like
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>),
but add callbacks to individual widget events when
needed so the YCP application can do some more fine-grained control of
individual events.
</li>

<li>
Keep multiple event loops, but return more information than this simplistic
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>
that can return no more than one single ID.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Having just a single event loop would not really solve any problem, but create
a lot of new ones: A sequence of <i>wizard</i> style dialogs would be really
hard to program. Switching back and forth between individual wizard dialogs
would have to be moved into some callbacks, and a lot of status data for them
all to share (which dialog, widget status etc.) would have to be made global.
<p>
What a mess. We certainly don't want that.
<p>
All the callback-driven models have one thing in common: Most of the
application logic would have to be split up and moved into the callbacks. The
sequence of operations would be pretty much invisible to the application
developer, thus the logical workflow would be pretty much lost.
<p>
Most who discussed that agreed that we don't want that, too.
<p>
Add to that the formalisms that would be required for having callbacks: Either
add a piece of callback code (at least a function name) to
<i>UI::OpenDialog()</i> for each widget that should get callbacks or provide a
new UI builtin function like, say, <i>UI::SetCallback()</i> or
<i>UI::AddCallback()</i> that gets a YCP map that specifies at least the widget
to add the callback to, the event to react to and the code (or at least a
function name) to execute and some transparent <i>client data</i> where the
application can pass arbitrary data to the callback to keep the amount of
required global data down.
</p>
While we are at it, add some logical counterparts like
<i>UI::RemoveCallback()</i>.
<p>
It might look about like this:

<pre class="code">

define void selectionChanged( any widgetID, map event, any clientData ) ``{
    ...
    // Handle SelectionChanged event
    ...
};

define void activated( any widgetID, map event, any clientData ) ``{
    ...
    // Handle Activated event
    ...
};

...
UI::OpenDialog(
               ...
               `Table(`id(`devices ), ... ),
               ...
              )
...
UI::AddCallback(`id(`devices ), `SelectionChanged, nil );
UI::AddCallback(`id(`devices ), `Activated, nil );

</pre>

<p>
If you think "oh, that doesn't look all too bad", think twice. This example is
trivial, yet there are already three separate places that address similar
things:

<ul>

<li>
The callback definitions. Agreed, you'll need some kind of code that actually
does the application's business somewhere anyway.
But chances are that the callbacks are no more than mere wrappers that call
the functions that actually do the application's operations. You don't want to
mix up all the back engine code with the UI related stuff.

<li>Widget creation with <i>UI::OpenDialog()</i>

<li>Adding callbacks with <i>UI::AddCallback()</i>

</ul>

<p>
A lot of GUI toolkits do it very much this way - most Xt based toolkits for
example (OSF/Motif, Athena widgets, ...). But this used to be a source of
constant trouble: Change a few things here and be sure that revenge will come
upon you shortly. It simply adds to the overall complexity of something that is
already complex enough - way enough.
<p>
Bottom line: Having callbacks is not really an improvement.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
What remains is to stick to the general model of YaST2 but return more
information - of course while remaining compatible with existing YCP code.
We don't want (neither can we economically afford to) break all existing YCP
code. So the existing UI builtin functions like
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a> or
<a href="event-builtins.html#PollInput">PollInput()</a>
have to remain exactly the same. But of course we can easily add a completely
new UI builtin function that does return more information.
<p>
This is what we did. This is how
<a href="event-builtins.html#WaitForEvent">WaitForEvent()</a>
came into existence. It behaves like
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>,
but it returns more information about what really happened - in the form of an
event <i>map</i> rather than just a single ID. That map contains that ID (of
course) plus
<a href="event-reference.html#event_map">additional data</a> depending on the
event that occured.
<p>
One charming advantage of just adding another UI builtin is that existing code
does not need to be touched at all. Only if you want to take advantage of the
additional information returned by
<a href="event-builtins.html#WaitForEvent">WaitForEvent()</a>
you need to do anything at all.
<p>
So let's all hope with this approach we found a compromise we all can live
with. While that probably will not prevent
<a href="#downsides">those discussions</a>
by new team members, maybe it will calm down the current team members'
discussion a bit. ;-)




<h1><a name="delivery">Event Delivery</a></h1>

<h2><a name="queues">Event Queues vs. One Single Pending Event</a></h2>

<p>
Since the YaST2 UI doesn't have a single
<a href="#classic_gui">event loop</a>
where the program spends most of its time, an indefinite period of time may
pass between causing an event (e.g., the user clicks on a widget) and event
<i>delivery</i> - the time where the (YCP) application actually receives the
event and begins processing it. The time gap between that depends on when the
YCP code executes the next
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>
etc. statement.
<p>
This of course means that events that occured in the mean time need to be
stored somewhere for the YCP code to pick them up with
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>
etc.
<p>
The first approach that automatically comes to mind is "use a queue and deliver
them first-in, first-out". But this brings along its own problems:

<p>
Events are only useful in the context of the dialog they belong to. When an
event's dialog is closed or when a new dialog is opened on top of that event's
dialog (a popup for example) it doesn't make any more sense to handle that
event. Even worse, it will usually lead to utter confusion, maybe even damage.
<p>
Imagine this situation: The user opens a YaST2 partitioning module
just to have a look at his current partitioning scheme.

<p class="info-box">
Side note: This scenario is fictious. The real YaST2 partitioning module is not
like that. Any similarities with present or past partitioning modules or
present or past YaST2 hackers or users is pure coincidence and not intended.
Ah yes, and no animals were harmed in the process of making that scenario. ;-)
</p>

<ul>
<li>The main dialog with an "OK" button (with, say, ID `ok) opens.
<li>It takes some time to initialize data in the background.
<li>The user clicks "OK".
<li>The background initialization takes some more time.
<li>The user becomes impatient and clicks "OK" again.
<li>The background initialization still is not done.
<li>The user clicks "OK" again.

<li>
The initialization is done. The YCP code reaches
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>.

<li>
Queued events are delivered (remember, this is only a fictious scenario - the
UI does not really do that). The first "OK" click from the queue is delivered -
i.e.
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>
returns `ok.

<li>
The initialization code found out that something might be wrong with the
partitioning or file systems. It might make sense to convert, say, the mounted
<tt>/usr</tt> file system from <i>oldLameFs-3.0</i> to
<i>newCoolFs-0.95Beta</i> - which usually works out allright, but of course you
never know what disaster lies ahead when doing such things with file systems
(and, even worse, with an experimental beta version).

<li>
The initialization code opens a popup dialog with some text to informs the
user about that. The user can now click "OK" to do trigger the file system
conversion or "Cancel" to keep everything as it is.

<li>
The handler for that popup dialog calls
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>
- which happily takes the next event from the queue - the `ok button click
that doesn't really belong to that dialog, but
<a href="event-builtins.html#UserInput">UserInput()</a>
cannot tell that. Neither can the caller. It simply gets `ok as if the  user
had clicked the "OK" button in the popup.

<li>
The program has to assume the user confirmed the request to convert the file
system. The conversion starts.

<li>
The experimental beta code in <i>newCoolFs-0.95Beta</i> cannot handle the
existing data in that partition as it should. It asks if it is allright to
delete all data on that partition. Another popup dialog opens with that
question.

<li>
The handler for that confirmation popup takes the next event from the queue
which is the third `ok click that should have gone to the main window. But the
handler doesn't know that and takes that `ok as the confirmation it asked for.

<li>
<tt>/usr</tt> is completely emptied. Half of the system is gone (along with
most of YaST2's files). The disaster is complete - the system is wrecked beyond
repair.

</ul>

<p>
Argh. What a mess.
<p>
Yes, this example is contived. But it shows the general problem: Events belong
to one specific dialog. It never makes any sense to deliver events to other
dialogs.
<p>
But this isn't all. Even if the internal UI engine (the <i>libyui</i>) could
make sure that events are only delivered to the dialog they belong to (maybe
with a separate queue for each dialog), events may never blindly be taken from
any queue. If the user typed (or clicked) a lot ahead, disaster scenarios
similar to the one described above might occur just as well.
<p>
Events are context specific. The dialog they belong to is not their only
context; they also depend on the application logic (i.e. on YCP code). This is
another byproduct of the
<a href="#y2_approach">YaST2 event handling approach</a>.
<p>
It has been suggested to use (per-dialog) event queues, but to flush their
contents when the dialog context changes:
<ul>
<li>When a new dialog is opened (<i>OpenDialog()</i>)
<li>When the current dialog is closed (<i>CloseDialog()</i>)
<li>When parts of the dialog are replaced (<i>ReplaceWidget()</i>)
<li>Upon the YCP application's specific request (new UI builtin <i>FlushEvents()</i>)
</ul>

<p>
Exactly when and how this should happen is unclear. Every imaginable way has
its downsides or some pathologic scenarios. You just can't do this right. And
YCP application developers would have to know when and how this happens - which
is clearly nothing they should be troubled with.
<p>
This is why <b>all current YaST2 UIs have onle one single <i>pending
event</i> and not a queue of events.</b> When a new event occurs, it usually
overwrites any event that may still be pending - i.e. events get lost if there
are too many (more than the YCP application can and wants to handle).
<p>


<h2><a name="reliability">Event Reliability</a></h2>

<p>
While it may sound critical to have only one single <i>pending event</i>,
on this works out just as everybody expects:

<ul>

<li>
When the YCP application is busy and the user clicks wildly around in the
dialog, only the last of his clicks is acted upon. This is what all impatient
users want anyway: "do this, no, do that, no, do that, no, cancel that
all". The "Cancel" is what he will get, not everything in the sequence he
clicked.
<li>
The YCP application does not get bogged down by a near-endless sequence of
events from the event queues. If things are so sluggish that there are more
events than the application can handle in the first place, getting even more to
handle will not help any.
<li>
YaST2 dialogs are designed like fill-in forms with a few (not too many)
buttons. The input field widgets etc. are self-sufficient; they do their own
event handling (so no typed text will get lost). No more than one button click
in each dialog makes sense anyway. After that the user has to wait for the next
dialog to answer more questions. It does not make any sense to queue events
here; the context in the next dialog is different anyway.

</ul>

<p>
As described <a href="#queues">above</a>, events can and do get lost if there
are too many of them. This is not a problem for button clicks (the most common
type of event), and it should not be a problem for any other events if the
YCP application is written <a href="#defensive_programming">defensively</a>.




<h2><a name="defensive_programming">Defensive Programming</a></h2>

<p>
Don't take anything for granted. Never rely on any specific event to always
occur to make the application work allright.
<p>
In particular, never rely on individual
<a href="event-reference.html#SelectionChanged">SelectionChanged WidgetEvents</a>
to keep several widgets in sync with each other. If the user clicks faster than
the application can handle, don't simply count those events to find out what to
do. Always treat that as a hint to find out what exactly happened:
Ask the widgets about their current status. They know best. They are what the
user sees on the screen. Don't surprise the user with other values than what he
can see on-screen.
<p>
In the past, some widgets that accepted initially selected items upon creation
had sometimes triggered events for that initial selection, sometimes not. Even
though it is a performance optimization goal of the UI to suppress such
program-generated events, it cannot be taken for granted if they occur or
not. But it's easy not to rely on that. Instead of writing code like this:

<pre class="code">
{
    // Example <em>how NOT to do things</em>

    <b>UI::OpenDialog</b>(
                   ...
		   `<a href="../widgets/YSelectionBox-widget.html">SelectionBox</a>(`id(`colors ),
                                 [
				  `item(`id("FF0000"), "Red" ),
				  `item(`id("00FF00"), "Blue",<em>true</em>),  // Initially selected
				  `item(`id("0000FF"), "Green" )
                                 ] ),
                  );

    // Intentionally NOT setting the initial color:
    //
    // Selecting an item in the SelectionBox upon creation will trigger a
    // SelectionChanged event right upon entering the event loop.
    // The SelectionChanged handler code will take care of setting the initial color.
    // <em>THIS IS A STUPID IDEA!</em>

    <b>map</b> event = $[];

    repeat
    {
        event = <b>UI::WaitForEvent()</b>;

        if ( event["ID"]:nil == `colors )
        {
            if ( <b>event["EventReason"]</b>:nil == "SelectionChanged" )
            {
                // Handle color change
		setColor( <b>UI::QueryWidget</b>(`id(`colors ), `SelectedItem ) );
            }
        }
        ...
    } until ( event["ID"]:nil == `close );
}

</pre>

Write code like that:

<pre class="code">
{
    // Fixed the broken logic in the example above

    <b>UI::OpenDialog</b>(
                   ...

<p>
It's that easy. This small change can make code reliable or subject to failure
on minor outside changes - like a version of the Qt lib that handles things
differently and sends another <i>SelectionChanged</i> Qt signal that might be
mapped to a
<a href="event-reference.html#SelectionChanged">SelectionChanged WidgetEvents</a>
- or does not send that signal any more like previous versions might have done.
<p>
Being sceptical and not believing anything, much less taking anything for
granted is an attitude that most programmers adopt as they gain more an more
programming experience.
<p>
Keep it that way. It's a healthy attitude. It helps to avoid a lot of problems
in the first place that might become hard-to-find bugs after a while.
