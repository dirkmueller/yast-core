<h1>Ini Agent implementation notes</h1>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>
Classes: <ul>
<li><b>IniAgent</b> is a communication point between ini file and ycp. Ini
agent contains <b>IniParser</b>. IniAgent passes parameters (control file) to
the IniParser.
</li>
<li><b>IniParser</b> is an object that parses control file, and reads/writes
ini file.
</li>
<li><b>IniSection</b> is a section descriptor. Also acts as a container of
values and sections.
</li>
<li><b>IniEntry</b> is a value descriptor.
</li>
</ul>
The data hierarchy is as follows: IniAgent contains IniParser. IniParser
contains IniSection, IniSection contains other IniSections and IniEntries.
</p>
<h3>IniEntry</h3>
<p>
Contains value, comment, index of rule by which is was read and dirty bit.
As you see, IniEntry doesn't know its name. IniEntries are, as you will see
soon, stored in a map, which uses names as keys. All we need to do with
IniEntry is: initialize/read/set.
</p>
<h3>IniSection</h3>
<p>
IniSection is more complicated. Besides the bunch of options, it contains
obligatory comment, dirty flag and index of rule by which it was read. This
time it knows is name. end_comment is a comment at the end of the section --
it is used to preserve the comment at the end of the file. Member <b>index</b>
is an index of all sub values and sub sections. It contains only a name and
information if it is a value or a section. It is necessary to keep the
information about order. Maps <b>values</b> and <b>sections</b> contain all
sub values and sub sections.
</p>
<p>
When the multiple file feature was added, we got another
set of rules - a mapping between section name and file name. But guess
what, the member read_by was used for both value rules and name
rewrite rules. It is a mess, causing bug #19066.<br>
So rewrite_by was added, but there are kludges: .section_type accesses
read_by or rewrite_by depending on whether there are none or any
rewrite rules, respectively. This information is passed as an extra
parameter to IniSection::{Read,Write}.
</p>
<h3>IniParser</h3>
<p>
IniParser does parsing of the ini file according to the control file. IniAgent
calls <tt>initFiles</tt> and <tt>initMachine</tt> to initialize flags and
structures. Method <tt>parse</tt> parses input file(s) and method
<tt>write</tt> writes it. Process of parsing a file is described in <a
href="ini.html">ini.html</a>. I am only describing multiple files hadling
here. Multiple files can be specified by 1 or more glob expressions. As we
check if the file changed on the disk for each read or dir, we have to save
the last known modification time and when we check if files weren't externally
changed, we perform the globing again and check the modification time of each
file with saved value (and possibly re-read the file). When reading/writting
multiple files, rewrite rules may take in effect. In such case we set index of
the rule to the read_by member of the section. Hence we have the index of the
rule which will be used for writing.
</p>
<h3>IniAgent</h3>
<p>
There is nothing interesting about it. Just look to <tt>otherCommand</tt> to
see how IniParser is initialized.
